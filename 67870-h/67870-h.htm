<p>Under the title of “Readers and Writers”
and over the initials “R. H. C.” I contributed
to the <i>New Age</i>, during a period of
seven or eight years, a weekly literary
causerie of which the present volume,
covering the years 1917-1921, is a partial
reprint. My original design was to treat
literary events from week to week with the
continuity, consistency and policy ordinarily
applied to comments on current political
events; that is to say, with equal seriousness
and from a similarly more or less fixed point
of view as regards both means and end. This
design involved of necessity a freedom of
expression rather out of fashion, though it
was the convention of the greatest period of
English literature, namely, the Eighteenth
Century; and its pursuit in consequence
brought the comments into somewhat lively
disrepute. That, however, proved not to be
the greatest difficulty. Indeed, within the
last few years an almost general demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
for more serious, more outspoken and even
more “savage” criticism has been heard, and
is perhaps on the way to being satisfied, though
literary susceptibilities are still far from being
as well-mannered as political susceptibilities.
The greatest difficulty is encountered in the
fact that literary events, unlike political events,
occur with little apparent order, and are
subject to no easily discoverable or demonstrable
direction. In a single week every
literary form and tendency may find itself
illustrated, with the consequence that any
attempt to set the week’s doings in a relation
of significant development is bound to fall
under the suspicion of impressionism or
arbitrariness. I have no other defence against
these charges than Plato’s appeal to good
judges, of whom the best because the last is
Time. Time will pronounce as only those living
critics can whose present judgments are an
anticipation of Time’s. Time will show what
has been right and what wrong. Already,
moreover, a certain amount of winnowing and
sifting has taken place. Some literary values
of this moment are not what they were
yesterday or the day before. A few are
greater; many of them are less. My most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
confident prediction, however, remains to be
confirmed: it is that the perfect English style
is still to be written. That it may be in our
own time is both the goal and the guiding-star
of all literary criticism that is not idle
chatter.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch1"><span class="smcap">Fontenelle.</span>—There is a reason that
Fontenelle has never before been translated
into English. It is not that Mr. Ezra Pound,
who has now translated a dozen of Fontenelle’s
dialogues, was the first to think of it. Many
readers of the original have tried their hand at
the translation only to discover that somehow
or other Fontenelle would not “go” in English
as he goes in French. The reason is not
very far to seek. Fontenelle wrote a French
peculiarly French, a good but an untranslatable
French. He must, therefore, be left and read
in the original if he is to be appreciated at
his intrinsic value. Mr. Pound has made a
rash attempt at the impossible in these
dialogues, and he has achieved the unreadable
through no further fault of his own. The
result was foregone. The dialogues themselves
in their English form are a little more dull
than are the <i>Conversations</i> of Landor, which
is to say that they are very dull indeed.
Nothing at the first glance could be more
attractive than dialogues between the great dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of the world. To every tyro the notion comes
inevitably sooner or later, as if it were the
idea for which the world were waiting. Nevertheless,
on attempting it, the task is found to
be beyond most human powers. Nobody has
yet written a masterpiece in it. Fontenelle
was not in any case the man to succeed in it
from an English point of view. We English
take the great dead seriously. We expect
them to converse paradisaically in paradise, and
to be as much above their own living level as
their living level was above that of ordinary
men. Here, however, is a pretty task for
a writer of dead dialogues, for he has not only
to imitate the style, but to glorify both the
matter and style of the greatest men of past
ages. No wonder that he fails; no wonder that
in the vast majority of cases he produces much
the same impression of his heroes as is produced
of them at spiritualistic séances. The attempt,
however, will always continue to be made. It
is a literary cactus-form that blooms every fifty
years or so. As I calculate its periodicity,
some one should shortly be producing a new
series.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch2"><span class="smcap">Biography.</span>—Very few biographers have
been anywhere near the level of mind of their
subjects, and fewer still have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
describe even what they have understood.
The character of a great man is so complex that
a genius for grasping essentials must be
assumed in his perfect biographer: at the same
time, it is so tedious in the analysis that the
narrative must be condensed to represent it.
Between the subtlety to be described, and the
simplicity with which it must be described,
the character of a man is likely to fall in his
portrait into the distortion of over-elaboration
or into the sketch. Though difficult, however,
the art has been frequently shown to be not
impossible. We could not ask for a better
portrait of Johnson than Boswell’s. Lockhart’s
<i>Life of Scott</i> is as good as we desire it to be.
Plato’s <i>Socrates</i> is truer than life; and there
are others. On the whole, the modern gossiping
method is not likely to become popular
in a cultured country.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch3"><span class="smcap">The Responsibility of the Press.</span>—From
his little brush with the Press, Dr.
Lyttelton has come off badly. It was not
because his case was bad, but because he had
not the moral courage to stick to his guns.
His case was that Parliament had practically
ceased to be the leader of the nation, and that
its place had been taken by the Press. Unfortunately,
however, the Press had come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
depend for its living upon sensationalism, with
the consequence that its tendency was to prefer
fiction to fact. A perfectly good case, I say,
who know more of Fleet Street than Dr.
Lyttelton will ever know. Every word of the
indictment is well within the truth. But when
challenged by the Press to substantiate his
charges, Dr. Lyttelton, instead of inviting the
world simply to <i>look</i> at the Press and to
contrast its reports with facts, proceeded to
exculpate the editors and to put the whole
blame on the public. It is the public, he said,
that is responsible, and there is no use in rating
the editors, who merely supplied what the public
wanted. But so long as public men adopt
this cowardly attitude nothing can possibly be
done, for the “public,” like a corporation, has
neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be
damned. Relatively to the proprietors and
editors of the Press the public consists of irresponsible
individuals, who merely choose from
among what is laid before them. They are
mostly as innocent as children who deal at a
tuck-shop, and, perchance, buy sweets and cakes
that are bad for them as readily as things that
are good for them. The responsible parties
are the proprietors and editors, and, above them,
the law. It is not an offence to buy articles
at a shop that are illegally displayed for sale.
The public supposition is that if they are on
sale they can be bought. And, in fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Public Prosecutor, unlike Dr. Lyttelton, does
not proceed against the purchasers of illegal
articles, he proceeds against the vendors. In
the case of our newspaper proprietors and
editors the conditions of shop-keeping are
parallel; they expose professed news and views
for sale, with an implied guarantee that their
goods are both good and fit for human consumption.
The public cannot be expected to
know which is which, or what is what, any
more in the case of news and views than in
the case of tea and potatoes. Rather less
indeed, since the ill-effects of false news and
unsound views are, as a rule, too long delayed
and too subtle to be attributed to their proper
causes. But the Press proprietors and editors
know very well. They know whether the news
they expose is true, or the views they vend
are sound. They know also that in a large
degree they are neither the one nor the other.
Yet they continue to sell them, and even to
expect public honours for their fraudulent dealings.
The excuses made for them are such
as could be made for any other fraudulent
industry; that it pays, that the public swallows
it, that honesty would not pay, that the public
does not want truth and sincerity, that the
public must learn to discriminate for itself.
Reduced to a simple statement, all these mean,
in effect, that the Press is prepared to trade
on the ignorance and folly of the public. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
long as editors and proprietors are allowed to
sail off from responsibility under the plea that
they are only satisfying a public demand, so
long will it be possible for purveyors of other
forms of indecent literature and vendors of
other articles of public ill-fare to complain
that they are unfairly treated. There is likely
to be always a demand for fiction against fact,
the plausible lie against the honest truth, the
doctored news against the plain statement, and
the pleasing superficial against the strenuous
profound. A change of taste in these respects
could only be brought about by a determined
effort in education extending over a generation
and applied not only to schools, but to the
Press, the pulpit, and to book-publishing. But
because the preference now exists, and is a
profitable taste to pander to, it is not right to
acquit the Press that thrives on it.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch4"><span class="smcap">Critics Beware.</span>—Mr. Crees, the author
of a new study of George Meredith, has first
pointed out one of the dangers in writing about
Meredith and then fallen into it. Everybody
knows what it is; it is writing in epigram,
or, as Mr. Crees calls it, “miscarrying with
abortive epigram.” That phrase alone should
have warned Mr. Crees how near he was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
ignoring his own counsel; but apparently he
saw only the idea and not the fact, for a
passage soon occurs in which he illustrates the
danger perfectly. He is writing of the difficulty
encountered by a certain kind of intellectual—Meredith,
for example—in winning any
public recognition; and this is the way he
miscarries on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The idol of the future is the Aunt Sally of the present.
The pioneer of intellect ploughs a lonely furrow. He is
assailed by invective, beset by contumely, the butt of ridicule,
the Saint Sebastian of the slings and arrows of outrageous
criticism. He is depressed by disregard, chilled by the
icy waters of contempt, haunted by the dread of beggary,
the recompense of strictness of conviction.... And when
detraction recites its palinode, his sole compensation is to
reply (from the Elysian fields), “I told you so.”</p>
</div>

<p>There are many untruths contained in this
passage, some flattering and others not, to the
“intellectual,” and they are properly expressed—if
untruths ever can be—in the style. The
style is one in which the truth cannot be told;
and it perfectly illustrates the axiom that critical
writing cannot be too simple and unaffected.
It is a common practice for a critic to approximate
his style to the style of his subject; for
example, to write about poetry poetically, about
a “grand impassioned writer” in a grand and
impassioned manner. By so doing it is supposed
that a critic shows his sympathy and
his understanding of his subject. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
method is wrong. Criticism is not a fine art.
The conversational tone is its proper medium,
and it should be an absolute rule never to write
in criticism what cannot be imagined as being
easily said.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch5"><span class="smcap">Henry James.</span>—The “Henry James Number”
of the <i>Little Review</i> is devoted to essays
by various hands upon the works and characteristics
of the late novelist. The most interesting
essay in the volume is one by Miss Ethel Coburn
Mayne reporting the first appearance and subsequent
development of Henry James as witnessed
by the writers for the famous <i>Yellow Book</i>, of
whom Miss Mayne was not the least characteristic.
What a comedy of misunderstanding
it all was, and how Henry James must have
smiled about it! At the outset the <i>Yellow
Book</i> writers had the distinct impression that
Henry James was one of themselves; and they
looked forward to exploiting the new worlds
which he brought into their ken. But later on,
to their disappointment, he fell away, receded
from their visibility, and became, as Miss
Mayne puts it, concerned less with the “world”
than with the “drawing-room.” The fault,
however, was not with James, nor was the
change in him. The <i>Yellow Book</i> too readily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
assumed that because James wrote in it, he
was willing to be identified with the tendency
of the school; and they thought him lacking
in loyalty when afterwards it appeared that he
was powerfully hostile. But how could they
have deceived themselves into supposing that
a progress towards the ghostly could always
keep step with a progress towards the fleshly?
The two were worlds apart, and if for a single
moment they coincided in an issue or two of
the <i>Yellow Book</i>, their subsequent divergence
was only made the more obvious. I, even I,
who was still young when the <i>Yellow Book</i>
began to appear, could have told its editors that
Henry James was not long for their world.
Between the method employed in, say, the
<i>Death of the Lion</i> and the method of Henry
Harland, Max Beerbohm, Miss Mayne herself,
and, subsequently, Mr. D. H. Lawrence, there
was, and could be, only an accidental and
momentary sympathy. James was in love with
the next world, or the next state of consciousness;
he was always exploring the borderland
between the conscious and the super-conscious.
The <i>Yellow Book</i> writers were positively reactionary
to him, for their borderland was not
between men and angels, but between men and
beasts. James’s “contemptuous” word for Mr.
D. H. Lawrence—which Miss Mayne still
groans to think of—was the most natural and
inevitable under the circumstances. It might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
have been foreseen from the moment Henry
James put his pen into the <i>Yellow Book</i>. If
there are any critics left who imagine that the
<i>Yellow Book</i> was anything but a literary <i>cul de
sac</i>, I commend to them this present essay by
Miss Mayne. Under the disguise of criticism
of Henry James, it is a confession.</p>

<p class="tb">Henry James’s <i>Middle Years</i> is a fragment
of the autobiography begun some years
before the author’s death. We are told
that this fragment was “dictated” by Henry
James and that it was never revised by
himself, both of which facts explain a little
of the peculiarity of his style. If the style of
the earlier books was mazy, the style of <i>Middle
Years</i> is mazier. If the earlier style consisted
of impressions impassionately conveyed, the
present is more elusive still. Henry James was
always difficult to pin down; in <i>Middle Years</i>
his fluttering among words never rests a sentence.
Nobody, I am convinced, who is not
either a genuine devotee of Henry James or one
of the paper-audience his friends cultivated for
him, will succeed in reading through this work.
An infinitely leisurely mind or an infinite
interest in just Henry James’s way of looking
at things is necessary to the endurance of it.
But given one of these, and in particular the
latter, and the reading of <i>Middle Years</i> becomes
an exhilarating exercise in sensing ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Yes, that is the phrase to describe what
Henry James was always after. He was always
after sensing ghosts. His habitat has been
said to be the inter-space between the real
and the ideal; but it can be more accurately
defined as the inter-space between the dead
and the living. You see his vision—almost
his clairvoyance—actively engaged in this recovery
of his experiences years before as a
young man in London. See how he revelled
in them, rolling them off his tongue in long
circling phrases. Is it not obvious that he is
most at home in recollection, in the world of
memory, in the inter-world, once more, of the
dead and the living? Observe, too, how only
a little more exaggeratedly anfractuous and
swirling his style becomes—but not, in any real
sense, different—under the influence of memory,
than when professing to be describing the
present. It is plain that memory differs for him
from present vision only in being a little more
vivid, a little more real. In order to see a thing
clearly, he had, in fact, to make a memory of
it, and the present tense of memory is impression.
What I am trying to say is that Henry
James mentalised phenomenon; hence that he
saw most clearly in the world of memory where
this process had been performed for him by
time; and that he saw less clearly in our actual
world because the phenomena herein resisted
immediate mentalisation. The difference for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
him was between the pre-digested and the to-be-digested;
the former being the persons and
events of memory, and the latter being the
events and persons of his current experience.</p>

<p>Henry James will find himself very much at
home with the discarnate minds who, it is
presumed, are now his companions. Incarnation,
embodiment, was for him a screen to be
looked through, got over somehow, divined into,
penetrated. He regarded it as a sort of magic
curtain which concealed at the same time that
under careful observation it revealed by its
shadows and movements the mind behind it.
And I fancy I see him sitting before the actual
sensible world of things and persons with
infinite patience watching for a significant
gesture or a revealing shadow. And such
motions and shadows he recorded as impressions
which became the stuff of his analysis
and synthesis of the souls that originated them.
But if that was his attitude towards the material
world—and it is further proved by his occasional
excursions into the completely ghostly—may
we not safely conclude that in the world
he now inhabits his sense of impressions is
more at home still. For there, as I take it,
the curtain is drawn, and minds and souls are
by one degree the more exposed to direct
vision. With his marvellous insight into the
actual, what would Henry James not make of
the mental and psychic when these are no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
longer concealed by the material? On the
whole, nobody is likely to be happier “dead”
than Henry James.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch6"><span class="smcap">Turgenev.</span>—Both in Mr. Conrad’s Introduction
and Mr. Edward Garnett’s critical study of
Turgenev I observe the attitude of defence.
They are defending rather than praising
Turgenev. But Turgenev has been so long the
victim of polemics that it is about time some
judge summed up the contentions and delivered
judgment. Neither Mr. Conrad nor Mr.
Garnett, however, is qualified for this task by
either temper or the power of judgment itself.
Mr. Conrad is a great writer, but he is not
a great critic, and as for Mr. Garnett, he is
not even a great writer; and the temper of
both is shown in their common tendency to
abuse not only the plaintiff’s attorney but the
jury as well. But there is no use in abusing
the jury—in other words, the reading public of
the world—even if some gain may be got by
polemics with this or that critic. I am content
to hear Mr. Maurice Baring and M. Haumont
told that they are merely echoes of Russian
partisanship and incapable of feeling the fine
shades of “truth” in Turgenev; for both
these writers are quite capable of hitting back.
But when Mr. Conrad satirically remarks that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Turgenev had qualities enough to ruin the prospects
of any writer, and Mr. Garnett echoes <i>him</i>
to the effect that Turgenev owes his “unpopularity”
to “an exquisite feeling for balance”
which nowadays is “less and less prized by
modern opinion,” I feel that the defence of
Turgenev is exceeding the limits of discretion.
For it is not by any means the case that the
“unpopularity” of Turgenev is confined to
the mob that has no feeling for balance or is
jealous of his possession of too many qualities.
Critics as good as Mr. Garnett and with no
Russian political prejudices against Turgenev
can come to the same conclusion as the innumerable
anonymous gentlemen of the jury, to
wit, that Turgenev was a great artist on a small
scale whose faults were large. That is certainly
my own case. While I agree (or affirm, for I
am quite willing to take the initiative), that
Turgenev’s art is more exquisite, more humane,
more European than that of any other Russian
writer, I must also maintain that in timidity of
thought, in sentimentality, in occasional pettiness
of mind, he is no more of a great writer
than, let us say, Mr. Hall Caine. To compare
the whole of him with the whole of Dostoievski
is to realise in an instant the difference between
a writer great in parts and a writer great even
in his faults. Turgenev at his best is a European,
I would rather say a Parisianised Russian;
but Dostoievski, while wholly Russian, belongs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
to the world. An almost exact parallel is
afforded by the case of Ibsen and Björnson,
about whose respective values Norway used to
dispute as now Mr. Garnett would have us
dispute concerning the respective values of
Dostoievski and Turgenev. The world has
settled the first in favour of Ibsen—with Norway
dissenting; the world will similarly settle the
latter in favour of Dostoievski, with Mr. Garnett
dissenting.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch7"><span class="smcap">Plotinus.</span>—Plotinus, of whom Coleridge
said that “no writer more wants, better
deserves, or is less likely to obtain a new and
more correct translation,” has lately been translated
into excellent English by Mr. Stephen
Mackenna (<i>not</i> the author of <i>Sonia</i>, by the
way). For all Coleridge’s demand and Mr.
Mackenna’s supply, however, Plotinus is not
likely to be read as much as he deserves.
Abstract thought, or thinking in ideas without
images, is a painful pleasure, comparable to
exercises designed and actually effective to
physical health. There is no doubt whatever
that mental power is increased by abstract
thought. Abstract thinking is almost a recipe
for the development of talent. But it is so
distasteful to mental inertia and habit that even
people who have experienced its immense profit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are disinclined to persist in it. It was by
reason of his persistence in an exercise peculiarly
irksome to the Western mind that
Plotinus approached the East more nearly in
subtlety and purity of thought than all but a
few Western thinkers before or after him. In
reading him it is hard to say that one is not
reading a clarified Shankara or a Vyasa of the
Bhishma treatises of the <i>Mahabharata</i>. East
and West met in his mind.</p>

<p>Plotinus’s aim, like that of all thinkers in the
degree of their conception, is, in Coleridge’s
words, “the perfect spiritualisation of all the
laws of Nature into laws of intuition and intellect.”
It is the subsumption of phenomena
in terms of personality, the reduction of Nature
to the mind of man. Conversely it will be seen
that the process may be said to personalise
Nature; in other words, to assume the presence
in natural phenomena of a kind of personal
intelligence. If this be animism, I decline to
be shocked by it on that account; for in that
event the highest philosophy and one of the
lowest forms of religion coincide, and there is
no more to be said of it. The danger of this
reasoning from mind to Nature and from
Nature to mind is anthropomorphism. We
tend to make Nature in our own image, or,
conversely, <i>à la</i> Nietzsche, to make ourselves
after the image of Nature. But the greater
the truth the greater is the peril of it; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
thinkers must be on their guard to avoid the
dangers, while nevertheless continuing the
method. Plotinus certainly succeeded in avoiding
the anthropomorphic no less than the
crudely animistic dangers of his methods; but
at the cost of remaining unintelligible to the
majority of readers.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch8"><span class="smcap">The New Europe.</span>—It should be possible
before long to begin to discern some of the
outlines of the new continent that will arise
from the flood of the present war. That it
will be a new continent is certain, and that
it will contain as essential features some of the
aspects of the Slav soul is probable. For
what has been spiritually most apparent during
the war has been the struggle of the Slav soul
to find expression in the Western medium.
Russia, we may say, has sought to Europeanise
herself; or, rather, Russia has sought to
impress upon Europe Russian ideas; with this
further resemblance in her fate to the fate of
the pioneers of every great new spiritual
impulse, that she has been crucified in her
mission. The crucifixion of Slavdom, however,
is the sign in which Russian ideals—or,
let us say Slav ideals—will in the end conquer.
They will not submerge our Western ideas;
the new continent will be the old continent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
over again; but they will profoundly modify our
former configurations, and compel us to draw
our cultural maps afresh. In what respect,
it may be asked, will our conceptions be radically
changed? The reply is to be found confusedly
in the events of the Russian Revolution;
in the substitution of the pan-human for the
national ideal, and in the attempt, this time
to be made with all the strength at the disposal
of intelligence, to create a single world-culture—a
universal Church of men of good-sense
and good-will. This appears to me to be
the distinguishing feature of the new continent
about to be formed; and we shall owe it to
the Slavs.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch9"><span class="smcap">The Fashion of Anti-Puritanism.</span>—The
anti-Puritanism of the professed anti-Puritans
is very little, if any, better than the Puritanism
they oppose. The two parties divide the
honours of our dislike fairly evenly between
them. Puritanism is a fanatical devotion to
a single aspect of virtue—namely, to morality.
It assumes that Life is moral and nothing
else; that Power, Wisdom, Truth, Beauty, and
Love are all of no account in comparison with
Goodness; and doing so it offends our judgment
of the nature of Virtue, which is that
Virtue is wholeness or a balance of all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
aspects of God. Anti-Puritanism, on the other
hand, denies all the affirmations of Puritanism,
but without affirming anything on its own
account. It denies that Life is exclusively
moral, but it does not affirm that Life is anything
else; it destroys the false absolute of
Puritanism, but it is silent to the extent of
tacitly denying that there is any absolute whatsoever.
This being the case, our choice
between Puritanism and anti-Puritanism is
between a false absolute and no absolute, between
a one-sided truth and no truth at all.
We are bound to be half-hearted upon either
side, since the thing itself is only half a thing.</p>

<p>I am not likely to revise my opinions about
virtue from the school of Marx and his disciple
Kautsky. Marx was another flamen, a priest,
that is to say, of one aspect only of reality—in
this case the economic. That the moral
cant of a particular age tends to represent
the economic interest of the dominant class, is,
of course, a truism; but there is a world of
difference between moral cant and morality—and
the latter is as uniform throughout all
history as the former is variable. Moreover, it
is not by any means always the case that the
interests of the dominant class of capitalism
are identical with Puritanism. The interests
of capitalism to-day are decidedly with anti-Puritanism,
in so far as the effects of anti-Puritanism
are to break up family life, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
restrict births and to cultivate eugenics. What
could suit capitalism better than to atomise the
last surviving natural grouping of individuals
and to breed for the servile State? The anti-Puritan
propagandas of Malthusianism and
eugenics are not carried on, either, by Marxians,
but by the wealthy classes. Because he is a
shopkeeper, the Anglo-Saxon is to-day an anti-Puritan
in these matters.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch10"><span class="smcap">Popular Philosophy.</span>—The difficulty of
popular philosophical discussion is not insuperable.
It is all a matter of style. Mr. Bertrand
Russell, for example, manages by means of an
excellent style to make philosophy as easy to
understand and as entrancing to follow as
certain writers have made the equally difficult
subject of economics. It is, in fact, the business
of professional thinkers to popularise their
subject and to procure for their Muse as many
devotees as possible. In the case of Mr.
Bertrand Russell, his admirable style has been
put into the service of the most abominable
philosophy ever formulated. He is an accidentalist
of the most thorough-going kind who
denies that life has any meaning or purpose.
Life appeared, he says, by chance, and will
disappear, probably for good, with the cooling
of the sun; and he sings like a doomed cricket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
on a dissolving iceberg. But it is all the
more strange in my judgment that a man who
thinks thus can write as Mr. Russell writes.
There is a contradiction somewhere between the
simple richness of his style and the Spartan
poverty of his ideas. He thinks glacially, but
his style is warm. I suspect that if he were
psycho-analysed Mr. Bertrand Russell would
turn out to be a walking contradiction. In
a word, I don’t believe he believes a word he
says! That tone, that style, them there gestures—they
betray the stage-player of the spirit.</p>

<p>A philosophy written in a popular style is
not, of course, the same thing as a popular
philosophy. “From a popular philosophy and
a philosophical populace, good sense deliver
us,” said Coleridge, meaning to say that a
philosophy whose substance and not whose
expression only has been adapted to the
populace is in all probability false and is certainly
superficial. For in his <i>Lay Sermons</i>, published
a hundred years ago, Coleridge
supplemented the foregoing remark by deploring
the “long and ominous eclipse of
philosophy, the usurpation of that venerable
name by physical and psychological empiricism,
and the non-existence of a learned and philosophical
<i>public</i>.” Between a philosophic
public and a philosophic populace there is the
same distinction as between the “public” that
reads, let us say, Sedlák, and the “populace”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
that reads, let us say, Mr. H. G. Wells. Mr.
Wells is a popular philosopher; but that is
manifestly not the same thing as a writer who
is trying to make philosophy popular.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch11"><span class="smcap">Was Carlyle Prussian?</span>—In the <i>International
Journal of Ethics</i>, Mr. Herbert Stewart
makes a chivalrous attempt to deliver Carlyle
from the charge recently brought home to him
of having been a Prussian. Militarist Prussianism,
he says, rests upon a postulate which
would have filled Carlyle with horror, the
postulate, namely, that an autocracy must be
organised for war. I am not satisfied, however,
that Carlyle would have been filled with
anything but admiration. It is true that he
did not adopt the Prussian error of identifying
Might with Right. “Is Arithmetic,” he asked,
“a thing more fixed by the Eternal than the
laws of justice are?” Could Justice or Right,
therefore, be allowed to vary with the amount
of Might at its disposal—a deduction inevitable
from the Prussian hypothesis? On the
other hand, Carlyle cannot be said to have
been equally free from the more subtle error of
Prussianism, the assumption that Might can be
accumulated only by Right means. Might, he
said in effect, being an attribute of God, can
be obtained by man only as a result of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
virtue. Hence its possession presumes the
possession of a proportionate virtue, and a man
of Might is to that extent a man of Right also.
This subtlety led Carlyle into some strange
company for the moral fanatic he was. It
led him to glorify Frederick the Great and to
condone Frederick’s crime against Silesia. It
led him to despise France and to defend West
Indian slavery. Mr. Stewart must make his
choice between Carlyle as a confused ethical
philosopher and Carlyle as a Prussian. If he
was not the latter, he was the former.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch12"><span class="smcap">Is Nietzsche for Germany?</span>—Nietzsche,
we are told, is being read as never before in
Germany. It is certain that Nietzsche was
taken, if taken at all, in the wrong sense in
Germany before the war. The Germans did
with him precisely what the mob everywhere
does with the satirist; they swallowed his
praise and ignored his warnings. He is still,
however, more of a danger than a saviour to
post-war Germany, if only for the reason that
his vocabulary is for the most part militarist.
Culture is usually presented by Nietzsche in
the terms of combat, and the still small voice
of perfection is only heard in the silences of
his martial sentences. Now that Germany has
begun to re-read Nietzsche, will it read him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
any more intelligently than before? Is not a
critique of Nietzsche a necessary condition of
safely reading him—in Germany? There are,
undoubtedly, authors who are most dangerous
to the nation in which they appear. Rousseau
was particularly dangerous to France. Whitman
is inimical to American culture. Dr.
Johnson has been a blight upon English
thought. And Nietzsche, it may well be, is
only a blessing outside of Germany. Art and
thought, it is commonly said, are beyond
nationality and beyond race; and from this it
follows that it is only a happy accident when
a great writer or thinker is peculiarly suited to
the nation in which he happens to be born.
He is addressed to the world—why should his
message be specially adapted to the language
and people of his parentage? A nation runs
risks in accenting as its own the doctrines of
the great men who chance to appear among
it. Equally, a nation runs the risk of missing
its real chosen unless it examines all the great
men of the world. Chauvinism, either by
choice or by exclusion, is always dangerous.
We must take the good where we find it.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch13"><span class="smcap">Nietzsche in Fragments.</span>—The English
mind is easily “put off” a subject, and particularly
easily off a subject as uncongenial as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Nietzsche; and it has been known to remain
in this state for a century or more. Several
of our own greatest thinkers and writers have
had to wait a long period for their readers,
and by the time that the English mind has
recovered itself, they are often quite dead. It
is likely to be the same with Nietzsche. Having
the plausible excuse for being “off” Nietzsche
which the war provided, the English intellectual
classes—note that I do not say the intellectual
English classes, for there are none—will continue
to neglect Nietzsche until he has been
superseded, as I believe he will be before very
long. Psycho-analysis has taken a good deal
of Nietzsche in its stride, and it is quite
possible that the re-reading of Indian philosophy
in the light of psycho-analysis will gather
most of the remainder.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the remaining fragments will
be worth preserving, since indubitably they will
be the fragments of a giant of thought. As
Heraclitus is represented by a small collection
of aphorisms, each so concentrated that one
would serve for an ordinary man’s equipment
for intellectual life, the Nietzsche of the future
may be contained in a very small volume,
chiefly of aphorisms. He aimed, he said, at
saying in a sentence what other writers say
in a book, and he characteristically added that
he aimed at saying in a sentence what other
writers did <i>not</i> say in a book. And he very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
often succeeded. These successes are his real
contribution to his own immortality, and they
will, I think, ensure it. I should advise Dr.
Oscar Levy to prepare such a volume without
delay. It may be the case that Nietzsche will
be read in his entirety again, though I doubt
it; but, in any event, such a volume as I have
in mind would serve either to reintroduce him
or handsomely to bury the mortal part of him.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, really believe that
Nietzsche is about to be read, as never
before, in Germany. Dr. Levy has assured
us, on the report of a Berlin bookseller,
that this was indicated in the sales
of Nietzsche in Germany; but the wish was
father to the deduction from the very small
fact. Nietzsche was, before anything else, a
great culture-hero; as a critic of art he has
been surpassed by no man. But is there any
appeal in culture to a Germany situated as
Germany is to-day? I am here only a literary
<i>causeur</i>. With the dinosaurs and other
monsters of international politics I cannot be
supposed to be on familiar terms. My opinion,
nevertheless, based upon my own material, is
that Germany is most unlikely to resume the
pursuit of culture where she interrupted it after
1870, or, indeed, to pursue culture at all. And
the reason for my opinion is that Russia is too
close at hand, too accessible, and, above all,
too tempting to German cupidity. Think what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the proximity to Germany—to a Germany
headed off from the Western world—of a commercially
succulent country like Russia really
means. Germans are human, even if they are
not sub-human, and the temptation of an El
Dorado at their doors will prove to be more
seductive than the cry from the muezzin to
come to culture, come to culture. Nietzsche on
the one side calling them to spiritual conquests
will be met by the big bagmen calling them,
on the other side, to commercial conquests.
Who can doubt which appeal will be the
stronger? Germany refused to attend to
Nietzsche after 1870, when he spoke to them
as one alive; they are less likely to listen
to a voice from the dead after 1918. On
second thoughts, I should advise Dr. Oscar
Levy to publish his volume in Germany first.
For there he would show by one satiric touch
that no country needed it so much.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch14"><span class="smcap">The End of Fiction.</span>—Fiction nowadays,
we are told, is not what it used to be. We
are told that it is the modern university. It
is certainly a very obliging medium. But on
this very account it is as delusive as it is
obliging. It receives impressions easily, readily
adapts itself to every kind of material, and
assumes at the word of command any and every
mood. But precisely because it does these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
things, the effects it produces are transient.
Lightly come, lightly go; and if, as has been
said, fiction is the modern reader’s university,
it is a school in which he learns everything and
forgets everything. Modern as I am, and
hopeful as I am of modernity, I cannot think
that the predominance of fiction, even of such
fiction as is written to-day, is a good sign;
and when we see that it leads nowhere, that
the people who read much of it never read
anything else, and that it is an intellectual
<i>cul-de-sac</i>, our alarm at the phenomenon is the
greater. What kind of minds do we expect
to develop on a diet of forty parts fiction to
two of all other forms of literature? Assuming
the free libraries to be the continuation schools
of the public, what is their value if the only
lessons taken in them are the lessons of fiction?
I will not dwell on the obvious discouragement
the figures are to every serious <i>writer</i>, for
the effect on the readers must be worse.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch15"><span class="smcap">The Criteria of Culture.</span>—The suppression
of the display of feeling, or, better, the
control of the display of feeling, is the first
condition of thought, and only those who have
aimed at writing with studied simplicity, studied
lucidity, and studied detachment realise the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
amount of feeling that has to be trained to run
quietly in harness. The modern failure (as
compared with the success of the Greeks) to
recognise feeling as an essential element of
lucidity and the rest of the virtues of literary
form is due to an excess of fiction. Just
because fiction expresses everything it really
impresses nothing. Its feeling evaporates as
fast as it exudes. The sensation, nevertheless,
is pleasant, for the reader appears to be witnessing
genuine feeling genuinely expressing
itself; and he fails to remember that what is
true of a person is likely to be true of a book,
that the more apparent, obvious, and demonstrated
the feelings, the more superficial, unreal,
and transient they probably are. As a matter
of cold-blooded fact, it has been clearly shown
during the course of the war that precisely our
most “passionate” novelists have been our
least patriotic citizens. I name no names, since
they are known to everybody.</p>

<p>Culture I define as being, amongst other
things, a capacity for subtle discrimination of
words and ideas. Epictetus made the discrimination
of words the foundation of moral
training, and it is true enough that every stage
of moral progress is indicated by the degree of
our perception of the meaning of words. Tell
me what words have a particular interest for
you, and I will tell you what class of the world-school
you are in. Tell me what certain words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
mean for you and I will tell you what you
mean for the world of thought. One of the
most subtle words, and one of the key-words
of culture, is simplicity. Can you discriminate
between natural simplicity and studied simplicity,
between Nature and Art? In appearance
they are indistinguishable, but in reality,
they are æons apart; and whoever has learned
to distinguish between them is entitled to regard
himself as on the way to culture. Originality
is another key-word, and its subtlety may be
suggested by a paradox which was a commonplace
among the Greeks; namely, that the
most original minds strive to conceal their
originality, and that the master-minds succeed.
Contrast this counsel of perfect originality with
the counsels given in our own day, in which
the aim of originality is directed to appearing
original—you will be brought, thereby, face to
face with still another key-idea of Culture,
the relation of Appearance to Reality. All
these exercises in culture are elementary, however,
in comparison with the master-problem of
“disinterestedness.” No word in the English
language is more difficult to define or better
worth attempting to define. Somewhere or
other in its capacious folds it contains all the
ideas of ethics, and even, I should say, of
religion. The <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> (to name only
one classic) can be summed up in the word.
Duty is only a pale equivalent of it. I venture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
to say that whoever has understood the meaning
of “disinterestedness” is not far off understanding
the goal of human culture.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch16"><span class="smcap">The Fate of Sculpture.</span>—The art-critic
of <i>The Times</i> having remarked that “the
public hardly looks at the sculpture in the
Academy, or outside it,” Mr. John Tweed, an
eminent sculptor himself, has now uttered a
public lamentation in agreement with him.
Sculpture to-day, he says, is an art without
an audience; and he quotes a Belgian artist who
told him what heroes our contemporary sculptors
in this country must be to continue their
work in the face of a unanimous neglect. It
is not certain, however, that the sculptors of
to-day do not thoroughly well deserve the fate
to which they now find themselves condemned.
In the economy of the arts, or, if this phrase
be preferred, in the strategy of æsthetics,
nothing is more necessary from time to time
in each of the arts than an iconoclast—by which
I indicate not a destroyer simply, but a creator
of new forms. Such a pioneer is of necessity
a little rude to his immediate predecessors and
to such of his contemporaries as are sheep.
But in the end, nevertheless, if they will only
accept and recognise him, he will revive their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
art for them. But in the case of sculpture the
two such iconoclasts as have recently appeared—Mr.
Epstein and the late Gaudier-Brzeska—were
instantly set upon, not by the public, but
by their contemporaries, and walled within a
neglect far more complete than the neglect
sculpture in general has received. Just when
it appeared that they might be about to reawaken
public interest in carven forms, the rest
of the sculptors hurried to silence them, with
the consequence that at this moment there is
literally nobody engaged in sculpture in whom
the intelligent public takes the smallest interest.
As sculptors have treated sculpture, so the
public now treats sculptors. It is a pretty
piece of karma.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch17"><span class="smcap">The Too Clever.</span>—Neglect means nothing
very much; success is a matter of time for
everything that is really classic. On the other
hand, deliberately to incur neglect by writing
for the few involves the further risk of more
and more deserving it. Whoever makes a
boast of writing for a coterie sooner or later
finds himself writing for a coterie of a coterie,
and at last for himself alone. It cannot be
otherwise. As the progress of the classic is
from the one to the many, the progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
romantic is from the many to the one; and
the more sincerely the latter is a romantic, the
sooner he arrives at his journey’s end. The
involution of aim thus brought about is obvious
already in the succession of works of the chief
writers of the <i>Little Review</i>. They grow
cleverer and cleverer, and, at the same time,
more and more unintelligible. I am staggered
by the cleverness of such a writer as Mr.
Wyndham Lewis, and a little more so at the
cleverness of Mr. James Joyce. But in the case
of both of them I find myself growing more
and more mystified, bewildered, and repelled.
Is it, I ask, that they do not write for readers
like me? Then their circle must be contracting,
for I am one of many who used to read
them with pleasure. And who are they gaining
while losing us? Are their new readers more
intensive if fewer, and better worth while for
their quality than we were for our numbers?
But I decline to allow the favourable answers.
The fact is that the writers of the <i>Little Review</i>
are getting too clever even for coterie, and
will soon be read only by each other, or
themselves.</p>

<p>A characteristic example is to be found in
the opening chapter of Mr. James Joyce’s new
novel, <i>Ulysses</i>. This is how it begins:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Stately, plump Buck Milligan came from the stairway,
bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay
crossed. A yellow dressing-gown, ungirdled, was sustained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the
bowl aloft and intoned....</p>
</div>

<p>Now it is clear that such a passage has not
been written without a great deal of thought,
and if thought were art, it might be called an
artistic passage. But thought is not only not
art, but the aim of art is to conceal thought.
In its perfection art is indistinguishable from
nature. The conspicuous thoughtfulness of the
passage I have quoted is, therefore, an objection
to it; and the more so since it provokes
an inspection it is unable to sustain. Challenged
to “think” about what the writer is
saying, the reader at once discovers that the
passage will not bear thinking about. He
asks, for instance, <i>whence</i> Buck Milligan came
from the staircase; <i>how</i> he managed to balance
a crossed mirror and razor on a bowl’s edge—and,
particularly, while bearing them aloft;
and what mild air it was that sustained the
tails of a man’s dressing-gown. To these questions
deliberately provoked by the ostentatious
care of the writer there is either no answer or
none forthcoming without more thought than
the detail is worth. The passage, in short,
suffers from being aimed at a diminishing
coterie; and it succeeds in satisfying, I
imagine, only the writer of it who is alone in
all its secrets. Mr. James Joyce had once the
makings of a great writer—not a popular writer,
but a classic writer. To become what he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
he needed to be opened out, to be simplified,
to conceal his cleverness, to write more and
more for the world. But first in the <i>Egoist</i>
and now in the <i>Little Review</i> he has been
directed to cultivate his faults, his limitations,
his swaddling clothes of genius, with the result
that he is in imminent danger of brilliant
provincialism.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch18"><span class="smcap">Homage to Propertius.</span>—Mr. Ezra
Pound’s <i>Homage to Propertius</i> has drawn an
American Professor of Latin into the pages of
the American magazine <i>Poetry</i>. Professor
Hales is indignant at the attempt of Mr. Pound
to make Propertius intelligible as well as merely
accessible to the modern English reader, and
in the name of Scholarship, he begs Mr. Pound
to “lay aside the mask of erudition” and to
confess himself nothing better than a poet.
With some of Professor Hales’s literal criticisms
it is impossible not to agree. Speaking
in the name of the schools, he is frequently
correct. But in the name of the humanities of
life, of art, of literature, what in the world does
it matter that Mr. Pound has spelled Punic
with a capital when he meant a small letter,
or that he has forgotten the existence of the
Marcian aqueduct? Mr. Pound did not set out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
with the intention of making a literal translation
of Propertius. He set out with the intention
of creating in English verse a verse reincarnation,
as it were, of Propertius, a
“homage” to Propertius that should take the
form of rendering him a contemporary of
our own. And, secondly, all criticism based
on the text of Propertius is invalid unless it is
accompanied by a perception of the psychological
quality of Propertius as he lived. But
Professor Hales, it is clear, has no sense for this
higher kind of criticism, for he complains that
there is “no hint” in Propertius’s text of
“certain decadent meanings” which Mr.
Pound attributes to him. Is there not, indeed?
Accepting decadence in its modern American
meaning, Propertius can only be said to be
full of it. No literary critic, accustomed to
reading through and between an author’s lines,
whether they be Latin, Greek, or English, can
doubt the evidence of his trained senses that
the mind behind the text of Propertius was
a mind which the Latin Professor of the
Chicago University would call decadent, if only
it expressed itself in English. The facts that
Propertius was a poet contemporary with Ovid,
that he wrote of the life of the luxurious Roman
Empire, as one who habitually lived it, that
he wrote of love and of his own adventures,
are quite sufficient to prove that he was a child
of his age; and if his age was, as it undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
was, decadent, in a professorial
sense, Propertius, we may be sure, shared its
decadence. I am not saying, it will be
observed, nor, I think, would Mr. Pound say,
that to have shared in decadence and to be
sympathetic to it are the same thing as to be
decadent in oneself. What, in fact, distinguishes
Propertius is his æsthetic reaction
against decadence, against the very decadence
in which he had been brought up, and with
which he had sympathised. But this is not
to admit that “no hint of certain decadent
meanings” is to be found in him. On the
contrary, he could not very well have become
the æsthetic reaction against decadence without
importing into his verse more than a hint of
certain decadent meanings. In effect, Propertius
is the compendium of the Roman
Empire at its turning point in the best minds.
Long before history with its slow sequence of
events proved to the gross senses of mankind
that Empire was a moral and æsthetic blunder,
Propertius discovered the fact for himself and
recorded his judgment in the æsthetic form of
his exquisite verse. But he must have passed
through decadence in order to have arrived
at his final judgment; and, indeed, as I have
said, his verse bears witness of it. Professor
Hales has been misled by Propertius’s reflections,
by his habit of sublimating his experiences,
by his criticism of decadence. But that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
reflection was only an accompaniment, or,
rather, sequel of Propertius’s mode of life; it
did not, any more than such reflection does
to-day, make impossible or even improbable
a mode of life in violent contrast with the
reflection made upon it.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch19"><span class="smcap">Mr. Pound and Mr. Wyndham Lewis in
Public.</span>—Mr. Ezra Pound has for some months
been the “foreign” or exile editor of the
<i>Little Review</i>; and I gather from the nature of
the contributions that he has practically commandeered
most of the space. A series of
letters and some stories by Mr. Wyndham
Lewis; letters, stories and verse, by Mr.
Pound; ditto, ditto, ditto, by other—shall I
say London?—writers—are evidence that Mr.
Pound’s office is no sinecure. He delivers the
goods. The aim of the <i>Little Review</i>, as
defined without the least attempt at camouflage
by the editress (that is to say, the real
American director of the venture), is to publish
articles, stories, verses, and drawings of pure
art—whatever that may be. It is not demanded
of them that they shall be true—or false; that
they shall have a meaning—single or double;
that they shall be concerned with life—or
fancy. Nothing, in fact, is asked of them but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
that they shall be art, just art. Less explicitly,
but to the same effect, both Mr. Pound and
Mr. Wyndham Lewis subscribe to the same
formula. They, too, are after art, nothing but
art. But in other respects they define themselves
more clearly. From Mr. Wyndham
Lewis, for instance, I gather that the aim of
the <i>Little Review</i> artists is to differentiate
themselves from the mob. Art would seem to
consist, indeed, in this differentiation or self-separation.
Whatever puts a gulf between
yourself and the herd, and thus “distinguishes”
you, is and must be art, because of
this very effect. And Mr. Pound carries on
the doctrine a stage by insisting that the only
thing that matters about the mob is to deliver
individuals from it. Art, in short, is the
discovery, maintenance, and culture of
individuals.</p>

<p>We have all heard of this doctrine; and
there is no doubt that it is very seductive.
But to whom? It has been remarked before
that the appeal of Nietzsche has often been to
the last persons in the world you would have
thought capable of responding to him; or,
let us say, to the last persons that ought to
respond to him—weak-willed, moral imbeciles,
with not enough intelligence to be even
efficient slaves. These, as Nietzsche discovered,
were only too often the sort of person that
was attracted by his muscular doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Will to Power. It is the case likewise with
the doctrine of individuality. Among its
disciples there are, of course, the few who
understand it; but the majority of them are
precisely the persons who prove by their
devotion their personal need of it. Individuality
is for these as much a cult as health
is a cult among the sick; and it is to be
observed that they also have to take a good
deal of care of themselves. They must never
associate with the mob, they must be careful
what they eat in the way of æsthetics; they
must pick and choose among people, places
and things with all the delicacy of an eggshell
among potsherds. Above all, they must
keep their art pure. Neither Mr. Wyndham
Lewis nor Mr. Ezra Pound belongs to this class
of æsthetic valetudinarians. Both are robust
persons with excellent digestions, and with a
great deal of substantial common sense. Nevertheless,
both of them, to my mind, pose as
invalids, and simulate all the whimperings and
fastidiousness of the <i>malades imaginaires</i>.
Read Mr. Lewis’s letters, for example, in the
issues of the <i>Little Review</i> here under notice.
The writer is obviously a very clever man,
with a good experience and judgment of life,
and possessed of a powerful style. But he
has chosen to exhibit himself as a clever gymnast
of words, with innumerable finnicking
fancies against this or that lest he should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
confused with the “mob.” And Mr. Pound
is in much the same state. What is the need
of it in their case, I ask? Unlike most of
the other writers, neither Mr. Lewis nor Mr.
Pound has any need to “cultivate” an individuality,
or to surround it with walls and
moats of poses. Neither has any need whatever
to appear clever in order to be clever.
On the contrary, both of them have need to
do exactly the reverse—namely, to cut their
too exuberant individuality down to the quick,
and to reveal their cleverness by concealing
it. Simplicity, as Oscar Wilde said—he, of
course, only said it, he never really thought
it—is the last refuge of complexity. And I
put it to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Pound that with
just a little more individuality, and with just
a little more cleverness, their ambition will be
to be indistinguishable from the mob, either by
their individuality or their cleverness. They
will not succeed in it. Individuality and
cleverness, like murder, will out. The aim,
however, of the wise possessor of either, is
to conceal it in subtler and subtler forms of
common sense and simplicity.</p>

<p>Among the clever poses of this type of
“stage player of the spirit,” as Nietzsche
called them, is the pose of the <i>enfant terrible</i>.
They are mightily concerned to shock the
bourgeoisie, and are never so happy as when
they have said something naughty, and actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
got it into print. Now it is, of course, very
stupid for the bourgeoisie to be shocked. The
bourgeoisie would be wiser to yawn. But it
argues a similar kind of stupidity—anti-stupidity—to
wish to shock them. But we
do not wish to shock them, they say! We
are indifferent to the existence of the bourgeoisie!
Our aim is simply to write freely
as artists, and to be at liberty to publish our
work for such as can understand it. Publishing,
however, is a public act; and I agree
with the bourgeoisie that the art of an intimate
circle or group is not of necessity a public
art. Between private and public morality,
personal and public policy, individual and communal
art, there is all the difference of two
differing scales of value. Queen Victoria did
not wish to be addressed by Mr. Gladstone
as if she were a public meeting. A public
meeting does not like to be addressed as if it
were a party of personal friends. The introduction
of personal considerations into public
policy is felt to be an intrusion; and to treat
your friends as if you were legislating on their
behalf is an impertinence. From all this it
follows that to thrust all private art into the
public eye is to mix the two worlds. Only that
part of private art that is in good public taste
ought to be exhibited in public; the rest is
for private, personal, individual consumption,
and ought to be left unpublished, or circulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
only privately. Let the artist write what
pleases him; let him circulate it among his
friends; the only criterion here is personal
taste. But immediately he proposes to publish
his work, he should ask himself, the
question: Is this in good public taste?</p>

<p class="section" id="ch20"><span class="smcap">Mr. Ezra Pound as Metricist.</span>—Under
the title of <i>Ezra Pound: His Metric and
Poetry</i>, a whole book—really, however, only
an essay—has been devoted to the work of
this literary enigma. For this honour, if
honour it be, Mr. Pound is indebted more
to what he has preached than to what he has
practised; for on his actual achievement, considerable
though it is, not even in America
could anybody have been found to write a
book. Mr. Pound will not deny that he is
an American in this respect, if in none other,
that he always likes to hitch his wagon to a
star. He has always a ton of precept for a
pound of example. And in America, more
than in any other country save, perhaps, Germany,
it appears to be required of a man
that there shall be “significant” intention, aim,
theory—anything you like expressive of
direction—in everything he does. There does
not appear to me to be anything <i>very</i> original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
in the creation of poetic images, or even in
the employment of irregular metric; neither
of them can be said to constitute a new departure
in poetic technique. Yet Mr. Pound
has elevated each of them to be the star of
a cult, with the consequence that we now
have professed “schools” of poetry, calling
themselves Imagist or Verslibrist. These are
examples of what I mean in saying that
Mr. Pound loves to hitch his wagon to
a star.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that this habit of Mr.
Pound has its good as well as its somewhat
absurd side; there is only a step from the
ridiculous to the sublime. It must also be
affirmed, however it may reflect upon our
English critics, that it is precisely the good
side of Mr. Pound’s technique which they
usually condemn. For the good side consists
of this, that all the poets who can claim to
belong to the school of Mr. Pound must display
in addition to the above-mentioned defects,
the certain and positive merits of study of
their art and deliberate craftsmanship. No
poet dare claim to be a pupil of Mr. Pound
who cannot prove that he has been to school
to poetry, and submitted himself to a craft-apprenticeship;
and no poet will long command
Mr. Pound’s approval who is not always
learning and experimenting. Now this, which
I call the good side of Mr. Pound’s doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
is disliked in England, where it has for years
been the habit of critics to pretend that poetry
grows on bushes or in parsley-beds. That
poetry should be the practice of “a learned,
self-conscious craft,” to be carried on by a
“guild of adepts,” appears to Mr. Archer, for
example, to be a heresy of the first order.
How much of the best poetry, he exclaims,
has been written with “little technical study
behind it”; and how little necessary, therefore,
any previous learning is. To the dogs with
Mr. Pound’s doctrine! Let the motto over
the gates of the Temple of Poetry be: “No
previous experience required.” It will be seen,
of course, how the confusion in Mr. Archer’s
mind has arisen. Because it is a fact that the
“best” poetry looks effortless, he has fallen
into the spectator’s error of concluding that it
is effortless. And because, again, a considerable
part of the work of the “learned, self-conscious
craftsmen” is pedantic and artificial, he
has been confirmed in his error. The truth of
the matter, however, is with Mr. Pound.
Dangerous as it may be to require that a poet
shall be learned in his profession, it is much
more dangerous to deprecate his learning. By
a happy fluke, it may be, a perfect poem may
occasionally be written “without previous
study”; from too much previous study there
may also occasionally result only verse smelling
of the lamp; but in the long run, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
cultivation of poetry as an art, there is no doubt
that the most fruitful way is the way of the
craftsman and the adept.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch21"><span class="smcap">Mr. Ezra Pound on Religion.</span>—Mr.
Pound has been called over the coals for his
impolite dismissal of Mr. G. K. Chesterton
as a danger to English literature. But, good
gracious, Mr. G. K. Chesterton’s reputation is
not so frail that it cannot take care of itself
against a spirited idiosyncrasy. Mr. Pound
has expressed his honest opinion; but what
is discussion for but to elicit honest opinions,
and then to extract the truth from them?
There is undoubtedly a fragment of truth in
Mr. Pound’s view of Mr. G. K. Chesterton’s
influence, and it is this: that Mr. Chesterton
is a most dangerous man to imitate. His
imitators become apes. But that is not to say
that Mr. Chesterton is not himself a great
writer. Shakespeare is likewise a dangerous
man to imitate; and we should only be repeating
good criticism if we affirmed that the
influence of Shakespeare upon English style
has been on the whole bad. But this is not to
detract from the greatness of Shakespeare.
Every writer of a unique style is liable to ruin
his imitators; and, from this point of view, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
wise thing to be done is to classify good writers
as writers to be imitated and writers never to
be imitated. Among the former are the writers
whom personally I prefer; for I love best the
men of the eighteenth century, who aimed
at writing as nearly as possible like the world,
and through whom the common genius of the
English language spoke. But there is pleasure
and profit also in the highly individualised
styles of the latter sort of writers, beginning,
let us say, with <i>Euphues</i>, and represented to-day
by Mr. G. K. Chesterton. Mr. Pound may
have no fancy for the unique and personally
conducted style of Mr. Chesterton, but it is a
matter entirely of taste and not of judgment.
Should he announce that he cannot tolerate
Swift or Burke or Sterne, writers of pure
English, then, indeed, I should join in deploring
his judgment. As it is, I listen to his
remarks on Mr. Chesterton as I should hear
his opinions of crab-soup.</p>

<p>Coming to his views upon religion and upon
Christianity, I find myself not so much hostile
to Mr. Pound as bewildered by him; and yet
not bewildered to the degree of much curiosity.
Certain critical views of religion are stimulating.
Nietzsche’s, for example, or Huxley’s, or
W. K. Clifford’s, or even Frazer’s. You feel
they come from minds serious enough to take
religion seriously, and that they are expressive
rather of impatience with the superficiality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
current religion than of hostility to religion
itself. Nietzsche and the rest, in fact, were
not critical of religion and of Christianity
because they were themselves indifferent to
religion, but because they were too intensely
concerned with the religious problem to accept
the popular solutions. Mr. Pound, on the other
hand, does not appear to me to be a serious
thinker on the subject. He dismisses the
current popular solutions not only as if they
were, as they mostly are, superficial and absurd,
but as if the problems of conscience, the soul,
sin, and of salvation, to which these solutions
are trial replies, were non-existent or trivial.
It is his indifference to the reality of the
problems, and not his criticism of the popular
solutions, that keeps my mind at a distance
from Mr. Pound’s when he is writing on
religion. He does not so much as even irritate
me, he simply leaves me as indifferent to his
opinions as he is himself.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch22"><span class="smcap">Mr. Pound, Caricaturist.</span>—Mr. Ezra
Pound comes in for it again—as he always
does. His idiosyncrasies are the enemies of
his personality, and they will always, unless
he can amend them, militate against both his
work and his success. Mr. Pound appears to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
love to give his readers the impression that
he is no end of a fire-eater, and that he is
a charlatan of the first-water, setting up to
lecture better men on the virtues he himself
has never cultivated. It is an absolutely
incorrect picture, an exceedingly bad self-portrait,
a malicious caricature of himself. A
psycho-analyst would attribute it all to “compensation,”
to an attempt on the part of Mr.
Pound to disguise his qualities as defects. In
brief, Mr. Pound has not the courage of his
virtues. “No one,” says Mr. Hartley in the
<i>Little Review</i>, “admires Ezra Pound more than
I do ... but it is his celestial sneer I admire.”
A sneer, celestial or mundane, is,
however, the last gesture of which Mr. Pound
is capable. If anything, he is too benignant,
too enthusiastic, too anxious to find excuse for
admiration.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch23"><span class="smcap">The Admirable Victorians.</span>—I am prepared
to apologise if I have ever used
“Victorian” in a derogatory sense. But I
know I have not. I have too deep a respect
for the Victorian character ever to make light
of it, and especially for my own generation,
that can afford to laugh at so little. Mr.
Strachey’s “brilliant” essays, therefore, leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
me laughing at him rather than with him.
One is impelled to take him personally, and
to turn the tables upon Mr. Strachey with the
<i>argumentum ad hominem</i>. How do you compare
with the people you write about? For it
is the peculiarity of the Victorians—our grandfathers
and great-grandfathers—that whatever
we may feel about them in our current opinions,
someone has only to sneer at them to provoke
us to their defence; and what better defence
can they ask than to be compared, man for
man, with their critics? As a set-off to the
“brilliant” essays of Mr. Strachey—how easy
it is to be brilliant nowadays! I have recently
read, on the loan of his great-grandson, the
privately printed personal memoir of Wm.
Mattingly Soundy, who died in 1862, at the
full age of 96. For 24 years he was a member
of his local Congregational church, and for 46
years he was deacon. During nearly the whole
of that time he never missed a meeting, Sunday
or week-day, and was never known to be late,
though he lived two miles from the church.
It is the round of a machine, you may say,
and there is no wonder that the age was
mechanical. But I think of the passionate
mainspring that kept a “machine” going for
so long without a psychological breakdown.
What an intensity it must have had! What
a character! If to love it is impossible, it is
impossible not to admire it; and since we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
truly live by admiration, hope and love, it is
something for the Victorians that they can still
fill us with admiration. My own generation
(now past as a force) has provided the soul
of the world with nothing so fine.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch24"><span class="smcap">French Clarté.</span>—M. Vannier’s <i>La Clarté
Française</i> does not throw much light upon the
mysteries of French lucidity. He accepts as
self-evident Rivarol’s axiom that “what is not
clear is not French”—surely worthy to be the
national device of France; and he analyses
with admirable humour a considerable number
of examples of “clarté,” and the want of it.
But the mystery of lucidity remains a mystery
still. Flaubert’s practice of reading his compositions
aloud puts us on the most promising
scent, for it is certain that the French “clarté”
is eminently readable aloud and in company.
A great deal of our own literature is meant for
the eye and not for the ear, for the study and
not for the salon, with the consequence that
at its best it is the grand style simple, but
at its worst shocking. Written for the ear, and
meant to be read in company, French literature
is never grand, but neither is it ever
silly. Its range is society, while ours is
solitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p class="section" id="ch25"><span class="smcap">When Shall We Translate?</span>—There is
nothing particularly “masterly” from the
modern English point of view in Hobbes’s
translation of Pericles’s <i>Funeral Oration</i>. His
period of English prose appears to have been
ill-adapted for the translation of the Greek
idiom of the time of Pericles. To the usual
cautions against translations in general, we
ought to add the caution against translations
made in dissimilar epochs. It is not at any
time in the history of a language that a translation
from a foreign language can safely be
undertaken. In all probability, indeed, the
proper period for translation is no longer
in point of time than the period within which
the original itself was written. If the Periclean
Age lasted, let us say, fifty years, it is within
a period in English history of the same length
that an adequate translation can be made. Once
let that period go by, and a perfect translation
will be for ever impossible. And equally the
result will be a failure, if the translation is
attempted before its time has come. I do not
think that the Hobbesian period of English
was in key with the period of Periclean Greek;
nor, again, do I think that our period for perfect
translation has yet come. A “masterpiece”
of translation of Pericles’s <i>Oration</i> is
still, in my opinion, to be done. But I am
confident that we are approaching the proper
period, and in proof of this I would remark on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the superiority of Jowett’s translation over that
of Hobbes. Jowett, as a writer of original
English, nobody, I think, would compare with
Hobbes of Malmesbury. Hobbes was a great
pioneer, a creator of language; Jowett was only
a good writer. Nevertheless, the idiom in
which Jowett wrote, was more nearly perfect
(that is, fully developed) English than the
idiom in which Hobbes wrote. And since,
in point of development, the correspondence
between Periclean Greek and Jowett’s
English is closer than the correspondence
between Periclean Greek and Hobbes’s English,
Jowett’s translation is nearer the original than
Hobbes’s.</p>

<p>It would be a pleasant exercise in style to
criticise Jowett’s translation, and a still more
profitable exercise to amend it. To a mere
student of comparative values in Periclean
Greek and idiomatic English, some of the
errors in Jowett’s translation are obvious.
Such a student needs not to refer with the
scholar’s precision to the original Greek to be
able, with the approval of all men of taste, to
pronounce that such and such a phrase or word
is most certainly not what may be called
Periclean <i>English</i>. It stands to the totality
of reason that it is not so. We may be certain,
for instance, that Pericles, were he delivering
his <i>Oration</i> in English, with all the taste and
training he possessed as a Greek of his age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
would never have employed such phrases as
these: “commended the law-giver,” “a
worthy thing,” “burial to the dead,” “reputation
... imperilled on ... the eloquence,”
“who knows the facts,” “suspect exaggeration.”
Pericles, we cannot but suppose both
from the man and his age, spoke with studied
simplicity, that is to say, with perfect naturalness.
The words and phrases he used were
in all probability the most ordinary to the ear
of the Athenian, and well within the limits of
serious conversation. But such phrases as I
have mentioned are not of the same English
character; they are written, not spoken
phrases, and approximate more to a leading
commemorative article in <i>The Times</i> than to
a speech we should all regard as excellent. It
would be interesting to have Lord Rosebery’s
version of Pericles’ speech, or even Mr.
Asquith’s. Both, it is probable, would be
nearer the original than Jowett’s, though still
some distance off perfection. In another fifty
years perfection will be reached.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch26"><span class="smcap">Nature in Mind.</span>—The <i>Quest</i> contains an
article by Mr. G. R. S. Mead, in which he
suggests—and, perhaps, rather more than suggests—an
affinity, if not an identity, between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
the “laws” of nature and the “laws” of
mind. Ever since I read the following sentence
in Coleridge’s <i>Biographia Literaria</i>: “The
highest perfection of natural philosophy would
consist in the perfect spiritualisation of all the
laws of nature into laws of intuition and
intellect,” it has been at the back of my mind
as an aim to keep before philosophy. Whether
or not there is a drummer in every age with
whom the active thinkers keep in step, even
without being aware of the fact, I can only
say that more and more evidence of this
tendency of thought is coming to light.
Boutroux’s <i>Contingency of the Laws of Nature</i>
may be said to have most explicitly attempted
the sublimation—or, dare we say, the humanisation?—of
the natural laws; but Boutroux is
only one of many philosophers working in the
same direction. Other areas of study than
that of “pure” philosophy seem to have
yielded, or to be yielding, the same result.
Mr. Mead quotes, for instance, some recent
studies of Animism to show that Animism,
which, together with Anthropomorphism, we
used to dismiss as merely a primitive
mode of thought, may, after all, prove
to contain a truth, the truth, namely, that
Nature <i>is</i> living and intelligent, and, on that
account, not so far from human nature as we
had come to imagine. “The more we
penetrate Matter,” says Mr. Mead, “the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
akin to Mind we find it to be.” The world is a
creation of mind; and the more either of the
world or of mind we understand the more we
understand of both. It is a thrilling idea, the
conception of the world of nature as being the
externalisation of an intelligence akin to our
own. At the same time, it is, like all thrilling
ideas, associated with considerable danger.
The “superstitions” connected with it are
perhaps best left under the shadow that has
been cast upon them.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch27"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clive Bell’s Pot.</span>—Mr. Clive Bell
cannot escape the charge of literary insolence
by giving to his collection of essays the deprecatory
name of <i>Pot Boilers</i>. That the articles
he has reprinted were designed to boil Mr.
Clive Bell’s pot, and did, in fact, keep it
simmering, may be true enough; for the
<i>Athenæum</i>, in which most of them appeared,
was an eclectic journal with a surprising taste
for the bad as well as for the good. Mr.
Clive Bell’s modesty, however, is titular only,
for not merely has he republished these ashes
of his yesterday’s fire, but he imagines them
to be still ablaze. “It charms me,” he says,
“to notice as I read these essays, with what
care and conscience they are done.... I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
seem consistently to have cared much for four
things—Art, Truth, Liberty, and Peace.” These
are things which a more modest man would
have left his biographer and eulogist to say
of him; and even then not even friendship
would have made them true. To Art and
Truth, there are, of course, a good many
references in Mr. Clive Bell’s essays, but the
mere mention of these names ought not to be
regarded as an evidence of care for the things
themselves. Cannot the names of Art and
Truth be also taken in vain? In the two concluding
essays of the book are to be found
most clearly Mr. Clive Bell’s conception of
Art. It is indistinguishable from what may
be called the Bohemian conception. Art is
not moral, art is not useful, art is not a relative
fact; it is an absolute to which all these other
things are relative. The artist, again, is not
a “practical” person, and it is no use expecting
of him an interest in the non-artistic affairs
of the world. The war, for instance? It is
only a means to art, and what should be said
of artists who abandon the end to occupy
themselves with the means?</p>

<p>But this Bohemian and superior attitude is
consistent apparently with some very mundane
bitterness. Mr. Clive Bell does not appreciate
the war, which appears to have put him considerably
out, in spite of his Kensington
Olympianism. He is shocked at hearing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
“this is no time for art.” But, on the other
hand, he does not appear to be able to escape
from the war. The penultimate essay is about
<i>Art and the War</i>, and the first essay is a
palinode for the state of affairs to which the
war put an end. According to Mr. Clive Bell,
the world before the war was in a most promising
condition of renaissance—of æsthetic renaissance.
“Our governing classes,” he says,
“were drifting out of barbarism....
‘Society’ was becoming open-minded, tired of
being merely decent, and was beginning to
prefer the ‘clever’ to the ‘good.’” But with
the war all this was interrupted—probably never
to be resumed; for what is the use of attempting
to establish an æsthetic culture upon the
state of poverty which will certainly ensue after
the war? Poverty and art, he as nearly as
possible says, are incompatible; it is only by
means of wealth, wealth in superabundance,
that art is possible. And since war is
destructive of wealth, “war has ruined our little
patch of civility” without bringing us anything
in exchange for it. The Bohemian view of
art is own brother to the Sardanapalian view
of culture in general; it presupposes great
wealth, while denying that art is a luxury.
Art is not a luxury or an elegant amenity
added to life, says Mr. Clive Bell. At the
same time, it is only when Society is wealthy
that art can flourish. The contradiction is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
obvious, and it pervades Mr. Clive Bell’s work.
It is not worth dwelling on a moment.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch28"><span class="smcap">The Criticism of Poets.</span>—Professor Rudmose-Brown,
the author of <i>French Literary
Studies</i>, is under the fatal illusion that it is
necessary (or, at any rate, proper), to write
about poetry poetically; and his comments are
too often in this style: “The illimitable night
of his obscurity is strewn with innumerable
stars.” But it is a style which is not only
repellent in itself, but doubly repellent from its
association with an exposition of poetry. Dr.
Johnson has written about poetry in the proper
style. He was respectful in the very distance
his prose kept from poetic imagery. Cold and
detached he may have seemed to be, but all
good criticism, comment, and even appreciation
labour of necessity under this charge. What
would be said of a judge who demonstrated the
emotions of the persons before him; or,
equally, of a judge who did not feel them? To
be a critic or judge of poetry, or of any art,
requires, in the first instance, an intense sympathetic
power; but, in the second instance,
a powerful self-restraint in expression, manifested
in poetical criticism, I should say, by
a prose style free from the smallest suggestion
of poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p class="section" id="ch29"><span class="smcap">“John Eglinton.”</span>—Mr. “John Eglinton”
has been called “the Irish Emerson”;
but the description of the “Irish Thoreau”
would fit him much better. He is transcendental,
like Emerson, but after a different, and
a less high-falutin’ manner—the manner of
transcendental common sense. On the other
hand, he shares with Thoreau the quality of
passionate independence, and what may be
called adventurous solitude. “John Eglinton”
names his essays <i>Anglo-Irish</i>, and they answer
even more accurately to the description than
the compound implies; for they are essays
upon the hyphen that joins them. Exactly
as Thoreau was most completely at home in
no other man’s land between the world and
the wood, “John Eglinton” is at his easiest
somewhere between England and Ireland. He
is not Irish, nor is he English. He is not
Anglo-Irish either; but, once more, the hyphen
between them. It is this sense of difference
from both elements that makes of “John
Eglinton” at once so attractive, so significant,
and so illuminating a writer and thinker. Being
between two worlds, and with a foot in each,
he understands each world in a double sense,
from within and from without. To each in
turn he can be both interpreter and critic;
and in these delightful essays he is to be found
alternately defending and attacking each of the
national elements between which his perch is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
placed. “Candid friend” would, perhaps, be
a fair description of his attitude towards both
nations, if the phrase were not associated with
the disagreeable. But since “John Eglinton”
is anything but acid in his comments, and
writes of both nations in a spirit of mingled
admiration and judgment, I can think of nothing
better at the moment than my image of the
hyphen. He is alone between two worlds,
friendly but critical equally of both.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch30"><span class="smcap">Irish Humour.</span>—Mr. Stephen Gwynn’s
<i>Irish Books and Irish People</i> contains an essay
on “Irish Humour.” Mr. Gwynn is severe
but just. He refers to the “damning effects”
of the “easy fluency of wit” and the “careless
spontaneity of laughter” which characterise
Irish humour. It would be terrible, however,
to have to admit that these divine qualities are
“defects” in the accepted sense of qualities
<i>manqués</i>; and the “defect” arises, I think,
not from the presence of these qualities in the
Irish genius, but from the absence of the
counterbalancing qualities of weight, high
seriousness, and good judgment. It would
almost seem that the “elder gods” departed
from Ireland centuries ago, leaving in sole
possession the “younger gods” of irresponsible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and incontinent laughter. As Mr. Gwynn says,
“Irish humour makes you laugh”; it always
takes one by surprise. But the laughter has
no echoes in the deeper levels of consciousness;
it rings true but shallow. Dogmatism on racial
psychology is dangerous, and I have no wish
to exacerbate feelings already too sore; but,
as a literary critic, I venture my judgment that
the Irish genius, as manifested in literature
during the last century, is wanting in the
solidity that comes only from hard work. Every
Irishman, speaking roughly, is a born genius;
but few Irishmen complete their birth by
“making” themselves. Wit comes to them
too easily to be anything but a tempting line
of least resistance.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch31"><span class="smcap">The Literary Drama of Ireland.</span>—While
exceedingly painstaking, thorough, and well-documented,
Mr. Boyd’s essay on <i>The Contemporary
Drama of Ireland</i> cannot be said
to add much value to the value of a record.
Unlike his recent volume of <i>Appreciations and
Depreciations</i>, his present work carefully, and
I should almost say, timidly, avoids coming to
any large and personal conclusions, save in the
case, perhaps, of the plays of Mr. St. John
Ervine. The reason for this diffidence I take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
to be rather an apprehension of what he
might discover were his real conclusions
than any inability to arrive at them; for
I cannot think that upon any other ground so
usually decisive a mind would have been content
to leave his readers in the dark. But what
then is it that Mr. Boyd may conceivably have
feared to discover? It is obvious enough, I
think, to an outsider—to one, I mean, who
does not belong to the coterie that calls itself
the Irish literary movement; it is that the
contemporary drama of Ireland is the history of
a rapid decline.</p>

<p>Mr. Boyd is, of course, honest with his facts,
and the material is thus before us for a judgment.
He does not conceal from us, for
instance, the illuminating circumstances that the
Irish dramatic movement actually began under
the impulse of the Continental movement, and
that its earliest authors were desirous, not so
much of creating an Irish drama, as of creating
a drama for Ireland. Mr. Edward Martyn,
who was undoubtedly the chief pioneer, was
himself a follower of Ibsen and aimed at writing
and producing what may be called Ibsen plays.
But this praiseworthy attempt to reintroduce the
world into Ireland was defeated by the
apparently incorrigible tendency of the native
Irish mind to reduce the world to the size of
Dublin. In rather less than two years, during
which time some six or seven plays were produced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the Irish Literary Theatre, founded by
Martyn and Yeats, came to an end, to have its
place taken almost immediately by the Irish
<i>National</i> Theatre, which was formed about the
group of Irish players calling themselves the
Irish National Drama Society. But what has
been the consequence of this contraction of aim
and of interest? That plays of some value as
folk-drama have resulted from it nobody would
deny; but equally nobody would maintain that
the world has been enriched by it in its
dramatic literature. Ireland, in other words,
has accepted a gift from the world without
returning it; her literary coterie has taken the
inspiration of the Continent and converted it
to a purely nationalist use.</p>

<p>Even against this there would be nothing
to be said if it succeeded; but fortunately for
the world-principle it can be shown that such
a procedure ends in sterility. As the reader
turns over the pages of Mr. Boyd’s faithful
record of the course of the drama in Ireland,
he cannot but be aware of a gradual obscuration.
One by one the lamps lit by Martyn,
Moore, and others, which illuminate the earlier
pages, go out, leaving the reader in the later
pages groping his way through petty controversies
acid with personality, and through an
interminable undergrowth of sickly and stunted
productions about which even Mr. Boyd grows
impatient. The vision splendid with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
record begins dies down to a twilight, to a
darkness, and finally to black night. The
world has once more been shut out.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch32"><span class="smcap">Mr. Standish O’Grady.</span>—Mr. Standish
O’Grady’s <i>The Flight of the Eagle</i> is not a
romance in the ordinary sense; it is not an
invented story, but an actual historical episode
treated romantically. The period is Elizabethan,
and the story turns mainly on the
careers of Sir William Parrett, an English
“Lord-Lieutenant” of Ireland, who appears to
have suffered the usual fate of a popular
English Governor, and Red Hugh O’Donnell
or Hue Roe of Tir-Connall, which is now
Donegal. If acquaintance with Irish history
is ever to be made by English readers, the
means must be romances of this kind. History
proper is, as a rule, carefully ignored by the
average reader, who must therefore have facts,
if he is ever to have them, presented in the
form of a story. It is only by this means, and
thanks to Scott in the first instance, that the
history of Scotland has penetrated in any degree
beyond the border. Only by this means, again,
have various countries and nations been brought
home to the intellectually idle English reader
by writers like Kipling. Both as a story-writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and as the first and greatest of the Irish historians
of Ireland, Mr. Standish O’Grady is
qualified to do for Ireland what Scott after his
own fashion has done for Scotland, namely,
bring his country into the historic consciousness
of the world.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch33"><span class="smcap">Mr. Standish O’Grady, Enchanter.</span>—<i>The
Selected Essays and Passages from Standish
O’Grady</i> is a priceless anthology of this
neglected author. Very few people in England
realise that Mr. Standish O’Grady is more than
any other Irishman the rediscoverer of ancient
and, in consequence, the creator of modern
Ireland. His very first work on the <i>Heroic
Period</i> of Irish history appeared in 1878; it
was published at his own expense, and had
a small and a slow sale; but to-day it is the
inspiration of the Celtic revival. “Legends,”
says Mr. O’Grady, “are the kind of history
which a nation desires to possess.” For the
same reason, legends are the kind of history
which a nation tends to produce. I am not
certain that it would not have been well to leave
the legends of ancient Ireland in their dust and
oblivion. They go back to remote periods in
time, and seem, even then, to echo still earlier
ages. It is possible, for instance, that Ireland
was a nation over four thousand years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Some contend that a Buddhist civilisation preceded
the Christian. Characteristically, it has
been thought that Ireland supported Carthage
against Rome. But what is the present value
of these revivals of infantile memories? They
cannot be realised to-day, and to dwell upon
them is to run the risk of a psychic regression
from waking to dreaming. “Enchantment,”
Mr. O’Grady tells us, “is a fact in nature.”
So potent a charm as himself has created may
have been responsible—who dare say?—for the
recall to present-day Irish consciousness of
early historic experience that were best forgotten.
Is it not a fact that the mood of
Ireland to-day is between the legendary and the
dreaming? Is not the “ideal” Irishman to-day
Cuculain of Dundalk talking and acting
in his sleep? It is a question for psycho-analysis.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch34"><span class="smcap">Les Sentiments de Julien Benda.</span>—I
thought for some time of translating <i>Les
Sentiments de Critias</i>, recently published in
Paris by M. Julien Benda. The style is excellent,
and M. Benda has the gifts of epigram
and irony; but, upon second thoughts, the
inappositeness of such a style to the situation
in which we find ourselves forbade me. As
M. Benda himself says, “there is no elegance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
about the war.” And success in writing about
it elegantly must needs, therefore, be a literary
failure. Critias’s “sentiments,” moreover, appear,
when compared with the real sentiments
evoked by the contemplation of the war,
a little literary. He is like a sadder and a
wiser Mr. Bernard Shaw flickering epigrammatically
over the carnage. Impeccable as his
opinions usually are, they are expressed too
lightly to be impressive, and too carefully to
be regarded as wholly natural. And that M.
Benda can do no other is evident in his <i>Open
Letter to M. Romain Rolland</i>, whom he considers
a prig. If he had been capable of
impassioned rhetoric it is in this address that
he would have shown his skill, for the subject
is to his liking, and the material for an indictment
is ample. But the most striking sentence
he achieves is that “We asked for judgment
and you gave us a sermon.” It is pretty, but
it is “art.”</p>

<p class="section" id="ch35"><span class="smcap">Convalescence after Newspaper.</span>—Matthew
Arnold used to say that to get his
feet wet spoiled his style for days. But there
is a far worse enemy of style than natural
damp; it is too much newspaper-reading. Too
much newspaper not only spoils one’s style, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
takes off the edge of one’s taste, so that I
know not what grindstones are necessary to put
it on again. Indulgent readers, I have been
compelled for some weeks to read too much
newspaper, with the consequence that at the end
of my task I was not only certain that my little
of style was gone, but I was indifferent in my
taste. The explanation of the <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> to which an overdose of newspaper
leads is to be found, I think, in the uniformity,
mass and collectivity of newspaper literature.
The writing that fills the Press is neither individual
nor does it aim at individuality. If a
citizen’s meeting, a jury, or the House of
Commons were to perform the feat of making
its voice heard, the style of their oracles would
be perfect newspaper. But literature, I need
not say, is not made after this fashion; nor
is it inspired by such performances. Literature,
like all art, is above everything, individual
expression. <i>Gardez-vous!</i> I do not mean that
literature is a personal expression of the personal
opinion of the writer. On the contrary,
it is the rôle of newspaper to give common
expression to personal opinions, but it is the
function of literature to give personal expression
to common opinions. And since it is
only personal expression that provokes and
inspires personal expression, from newspapers
one can derive no stimulus to literature, but
only the opposite, a disrelish and a distaste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>How to recover one’s health after newspaper
poisoning is a problem. To plunge back forthwith
into books was for me an impossibility.
It was necessary to begin again from the very
beginning and gradually to accustom myself to
the taste for literature again. Re-arranging my
books, and throwing away the certainly-done
with was, I found, as useful a preliminary tonic
as any other I could devise. In particular there
is a satisfaction in throwing out books which
makes this medicine as pleasant as it is tonic.
It visibly reduces the amount left to be read;
there is then not so much on one’s plate that
the appetite revolts at the prospect. And who
can throw away a book without glancing into
it to make sure that it will never again be
wanted? Picking and tasting in this indeliberate
way, the invalid appetite is half coaxed
to sit up and take proper nourishment. This
destruction and reconstruction I certainly found
recovering, and I can, therefore, commend them
to be included in the pharmacopæias.</p>

<p>Another nourishing exercise when you are
in this state is the overhauling of your accumulations
of memoranda, cuttings and note-books.
I have sat for hours during the last few days,
like a beaver unbuilding its dam, turning out
with a view to destroying their contents, drawer
after drawer and shelf upon shelf. It is fatal
to set about the operation with any tenderness.
Your aim must be to destroy everything which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
does not command you to spare it. The tragic
recklessness of the procedure is the virtue of
the medicine. As a matter of fact there is
little or nothing now left in my drawers for
future use. Nearly all my paper-boats have
been burned, including some three-decked
galleons which were originally designed to
bring me fame. No matter; the Rubicon is
crossed, and to be on the other side of newspaper
with no more than a thin portfolio of
notes is to have escaped cheaply.</p>

<p>For the humour of it, however, I will record
a careful exception. It appears, after all, that
I was not so mad as I seemed. Perchance
newspaper, being only a feigned literature,
induces only a feigned madness. Be it as it
may. I find that my current note-book, though
as handy and tempting to be destroyed as any
other, was nevertheless destroyed only after
the cream of it had been whipped into the permanent
book which I have kept through many
rages for a good many years. The extracts
are here before me as I write in convalescence.
It is amusing to me to observe, moreover, that
their cream is not very rich. Much better
has gone into the bonfire. Why, then, did I
save these and sacrifice those? Look at a
few of them. “Nobody’s anything always”—is
there aught irrecoverable in that to have compelled
me to spare it? “Lots of window, but no
warehouse”—a remark, I fancy, intended to hit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
somebody or other very hard indeed—but <i>does</i>
it? Is any of the present company fitted with
a cap? “The judgment of the world is good,
but few can put it into words.” That is a
premonitory symptom, you will observe, of a
remark made a few lines above to the effect
that literature is a personal expression of a
common opinion or judgment. I have plainly
remembered it. <i>Apropos</i> of the <i>New Age</i>,
I must have told somebody, and stolen home to
write it down, that its career is that of a
rocking-horse, all ups and downs but never any
getting forward. It is too true to be wholly
amusing; let me horse-laugh at it and pass it
on. “A simple style is like sleep, it will not
come by effort.” Not altogether true, but true
enough. The rest are not much worse or
better, and the puzzle is to explain why those
should be taken and these left.</p>

<p>Again <i>apropos</i>, may a physician who has
healed himself offer this piece of advice? Read
your own note-books often. I have known
some people who have a library of note-books
worth a dukedom, who never once looked into
them after having filled them. That is collecting
mania pure and simple. From another
offensive angle what a confession of inferior
taste is made in preferring the note-books of
others to one’s own. A little more self-respect
in this matter is clearly necessary if your conversation
is to be personal at all; for in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
probability the references and quotations you
make <i>without</i> the authority of your own collection
are hackneyed. They are the reach-me-downs
of every encyclopædia. Is this the
reason that the vast majority of current quotations
are as worn as they are; that a constant
reader, forewarned of the subject about to be
dealt with, is usually forearmed against the
tags he will find employed in it? In any case,
the advice I have just given is the corrective
of this depressing phenomenon of modern
writing. You have only to trade in your own
note-books to be, and to give the air of being,
truly original.</p>

<p>Browsing is a rather more advanced regimen
for convalescence than the re-arrangement of
books. The latter can be performed without
the smallest taste for reading. It is a matter
of sizing them up, and any bookseller’s apprentice
can do it. But browsing means dipping
into the contents here and there; it is both a
symptom of returning health and a means to
it. In the last few days I must have nibbled
in a hundred different pastures, chiefly, I think,
in the pastures of books about books. De
Quincey, Matthew Arnold, Bagehot, Macaulay,
Johnson, etc.—what meadows, what lush grass,
what feed! After all, one begins to say, literature
cannot be unsatisfying that fed such bulls
and that so plumped their minds. It cannot
be only a variety of newspaper. Thus a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
link with health is established, and one becomes
able to take one’s books again. Here I should
end, but that a last observation in the form of
a question occurs to me. Is not or can not
a taste for literature be acquired by the same
means by which it can be re-acquired? Are
not the child and the invalid similar? In that
case the foregoing directions may be not
altogether useless.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch36"><span class="smcap">Nature in English Literature.</span>—In observation
of Nature English literature excels
all others. But that is by no means to say
that every English writer upon Nature is good.
The astonishing thing is that contemporary with
such masters of both Nature-observation and
literary expression as—to name but two—Mr.
W. H. Hudson and Mr. Warde Fowler (and
half a dozen others could be named in the
same street) there should still be so many
writers insensible enough to perfection to write
about Nature when they have little to say and
few gifts of expression. You would think that
having seen the sun they would not light a
candle, or that if they did, nobody would look
at it. But the truth is that not only are many
candles lit, but they are all much admired—much
more, indeed, than the suns themselves.
There may be a good reason for it, namely, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the reading public is so much in love with
Nature-writing that the best is not good enough
for us. Or, again, everybody living in the
country and having a pen at all, wishes to
write his own Nature-observations as everybody
wishes to write his own love-lyrics, regardless
of the fact that the best love-lyrics have already
been written. It may be so; but the admission
appears to me to be over-generous.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy W. D. Izzard has published in
book form his “Year of Country Days” under
the general title of <i>Homeland</i>. The series has
appeared in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, where it appears
to have given pleasure to a considerable number
of readers. I do not doubt the fact. Even
the least suggestion of Nature would be a
relief in the stuffy and bawling atmosphere
of the <i>Daily Mail</i>. But in the form of a
book, in which three hundred and sixty-five of
them appear, they are almost intolerable. Their
value lay in their contrast to the surrounding
columns of the journal in which they were published.
Take away that background and let
them stand by themselves, and they are seen
to be what they are—pale, anæmic, and not
very knowledgeable commonplace observations.
Nothing really exciting appears to have happened
in the country under Mr. Izzard’s observation.
When reading Jefferies or Hudson
or Ward Fowler or Selous, you are made to
feel, in a simple walk along a hedgerow, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
something dramatic is afoot. Discovery is in
the air. But Mr. Izzard is never fortunate,
and all he has to record are the commonplaces
of the country-side, which I could as easily
reconstruct from a calendar as gather from his
text. “The silver clouds are heaped together
in billowy masses that sail with deeps of Italian
blue between.” How pretty! But the delight
is wanting.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch37"><span class="smcap">S.S.S.</span>—The Simplified Spelling Society has
broken loose from obscurity again in the issue
of a new pamphlet, called <i>Breaking the Spell;
an Appeal to Common Sense</i>. A preface contributed
by Dr. Macan rehearses all the old
“reasons” for simplifying our spelling with
as little attention as ever to the real reasons
against it. “Spelling,” we are told, “should
be the simplest of all arts.” It is so in
Spanish, in Italian, in Welsh, and in Dutch,
and it was so in Greek and Latin. Why not,
therefore, in English? The reasoning, however,
is ridiculous, for it assumes that it was
by some deliberate and self-conscious design
that these languages came to be spelled
phonetically, and hence that we have only to
follow them faithfully (and the advice of the
S.S.S.) in order to place our language in a
similar state. Language, however, is not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
product of logic and science, but of art and
taste. It is determined not by reason alone,
but by the totality of our judgment, in which
many other factors than reason are included.
To ask us to “reform” our spelling in order
to make it “reasonable” is to ask us to forgo
the satisfaction of every intellectual taste save
that of logic; a procedure that would not only
“reform” our spelling, but all literature into
the bargain. It is pretended that the adoption
of simplified spelling would have, at worst,
only a passing effect upon the well-being of
literature. If, for example, all the English
classics were re-spelled in conformity with
phonetic rules, and their use made general,
very soon, we are told, we should forget their
original idiosyncrasies, and love them in their
new spelling as much as ever. But people
who argue in this way must have been blinded
in their taste in their pursuit of rationalistic
uniformity. Literature employs words not for
their rational meaning alone, not even for their
sound alone, but for their combined qualities
of meaning, sound, <i>sight</i>, association, history,
and a score of other attributes. By reducing
words to a rational rule of phonetic spelling,
more than half of these qualities would be
entirely, or almost entirely, eliminated. A re-spelled
Shakespeare, for instance, if it should
ever take the place of the present edition, would
be a new Shakespeare—a Shakespeare translated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
from the coloured language in which he
thought and wrote into a language of logical
symbols. An exact analogy—as far as any
analogy can be exact—for the proposal of the
S.S.S. would be to propose to abolish the use
of colour in pictorial art, and to produce everything
in black and white. The colour-blind
would, no doubt, be satisfied in the one case,
and, in the other, the word-blind would be
equally pleased. Fortunately, both proposals
have the same chance of success.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch38"><span class="smcap">Sterne Criticism.</span>—Everybody knows that
Sterne’s <i>Sentimental Journey</i> broke off suddenly
in the second book at the crisis of a
Shandian incident. What everybody does not
know—I confess I only learnt it myself a few
days ago—is that Sterne’s Editor “Eugenius”
not only concluded the incident, but carried on
the journey to the extent of another two books.
He did this, he informs us, from notes and
materials left or communicated to him by Sterne
himself, and he is so frank as to say that he
has striven to complete the work in the style
and manner of his late friend. Having a
particular admiration for the style of Sterne,
which, to my mind, is the easiest ever achieved
in English, I have now a double resentment
against the presumptuous Eugenius. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
first place, I question the man’s veracity almost
as much as the veracity of Sterne himself is
to be questioned in the matter of Sterne’s intention
of completing his journey. The <i>Journey</i>
was a <i>tour de force</i>; it was the result, as it
were, of a challenge. Sterne had made a bet
that he would maintain the reader’s interest
in a series of the most trivial incidents by his
mere manner of writing about them. That he
had any other intention than that of showing
his power I do not for a moment believe;
least of all the suggestion that he had a plan
of writing in his mind which required the book
to be finished in four sections, four and just
four. Eugenius’s excuses that he had often
discussed the completion of the <i>Journey</i>
with Sterne, and had heard from him the
“facts, events, and observations,” intended to
be introduced into the unwritten book, are thus
a mere literary device for getting his own
work tied to Sterne’s kite. Even if Sterne
gave him authority for it, I should refuse to
believe it, since Sterne may easily have been
badgered into consenting; and, in any case,
is not necessarily to be believed upon a matter
of fact. One’s resentment is embittered by the
manner in which Eugenius makes the continuation.
It is notorious that Sterne never made
a statement that could definitely incriminate
himself. It was his whole art to leave everything
to his readers’ imagination, and to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
upon them the odium of the obvious interpretation.
An admission on his part would have
been fatal not only to himself, but to the style
and intention of his work, which may be
described as skating upon thin ice. Eugenius,
however, in spite of all the intimacy which he
says subsisted between himself and Mr. Sterne,
was so far from having appreciated the
elementary quality of the <i>Journey</i> that in
completing the very incident on which Book
Two breaks off, he falls into the blunder of
committing Sterne to a “criminal” confession.
I need not say what the confession is; it
is the obvious deduction to be drawn from
the description provided by Sterne himself.
And it is precisely on this account that I am
certain Sterne would never have made it.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch39"><span class="smcap">Sterne on Love in France.</span>—One of my
correspondents must have been reading Sterne
at the same time that I was being annoyed
by Eugenius, for he has written to remind
me of Sterne’s opinion of Love as it is understood
in France. “The French,” wrote Sterne,
“have certainly got the credit of understanding
more of Love, and making it better than any
other nation upon earth; but for my own part
I think them arrant bunglers, and in truth,
the worst set of marksmen that ever tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Cupid’s patience.” My correspondent recalls
the fact from the dark backward and abysm
of time that, in a discussion of Stendhal, I
expressed the same opinion; and he has, no
doubt, supplied the parallel in order to gratify
me. Gratifying it is, in one sense, to find
oneself confirmed in a somewhat novel opinion—which,
moreover, was thought to be original
as well—by an observer of the penetration of
Sterne. But it is less gratifying when one
reflects that Sterne was the last person in the
world to have the right to talk about Love
at all. What should a genuine as well as a
professed sentimentalist have to say of Love
more than that in its practice the French were
not sentimental enough for him? But it is
not the defect of sentimentality that stamps
Love as understood in France with the mark of
inferiority, but the presence of too much
egoism—a fault Sterne would never have
observed.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch40"><span class="smcap">English Style.</span>—The same correspondent
copies out for me Quincey’s “fine analysis
of Swift’s style,” as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The main qualification for such a style was plain good
sense, natural feeling, unpretendingness, some little scholarly
practice in the putting together of sentences so as to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
mechanical awkwardness of construction, but above all,
the advantage of a <i>subject</i> such in its nature as instinctively
to reject ornament lest it should draw attention from itself.
Such subjects are common; but grand impassioned subjects
insist upon a different treatment; and there it is that the
true difficulties of style commence, and there it is that your
worshipful Master Jonathan would have broken down
irrecoverably.</p>
</div>

<p>This “fine analysis” of Swift’s style does
not appear to me to be anything more than a
powerful attack delivered by an apostle of the
opposing school. Swift and de Quincey are
obviously poles apart in the direction of their
style, and I have no doubt that I could find in
Swift as severe an analysis of de Quincey as
my correspondent has found in de Quincey of
Swift. At bottom the controversy carries us
back to the very foundations of European
culture. On the whole, Swift followed the
Greek tradition—exemplified by Demosthenes—while
de Quincey followed the Latin—exemplified
by Cicero. There can be no doubt of
the school to which Swift belonged; his
<i>Drapier’s Letters</i>, for instance, were confessedly
modelled on Demosthenes. Likewise there can
be no doubt of the school which de Quincey
attended; he learned his style of Cicero. The
question, however, is one of taste, by no means
a matter of <i>non est disputandum</i>. Which of
the two schools of style is capable of the
highest absolute development; and, above all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
which is the most suited to the English
language? My mind is fully made up; I
am for the Greek and Demosthenes against the
Latin and Cicero. I am for Swift against de
Quincey; for the simple against the ornate.</p>

<p>De Quincey appears to me to fall into an
almost vulgar error in assuming that the style
of plain good sense cultivated by Swift is fit
only for commonplace subjects, and that
“grand impassioned subjects” demand an
ornate style. The style of Demosthenes was
obviously quite as well fitted to the high
subjects of his Discourse on the Crown as
to the details for the fitting out of an expedition
against Philip. The <i>Apology</i> of Plato
is in much the same style, and not even de
Quincey would say that the subject was not
anything but commonplace. With the majority
of English critics, I have a horror of fine
writing, and especially about fine things. The
proper rule is, in fact, the very reverse of
that laid down by de Quincey; it is on no
account to write upon “grand impassioned
subjects” in a grand impassioned style. After
all, as the Greeks understood, there are an
infinite number of degrees of simplicity, ranging
from the simple colloquial to the simple
grand. The ornate Latin style, with its
degrees of ornateness, is, on the other hand,
a bastard style. The conclusion seems to be
this: that the simple style is capable of anything,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
even of dealing with “grand impassioned
subjects”; whereas the ornate style
is only barely tolerable in the most exceptional
circumstances. I would sooner trust Swift than
de Quincey not to embarrass a reader on a
difficult occasion, as, for the same reason, I
prefer Shakespeare the Greek to Ben Jonson
the Latinist.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch41"><span class="smcap">Literary Culs-de-sac.</span>—A cul-de-sac occurs
in literary history when a direction is
taken away from the main highway of the
national language and literature; when the
stream it represents is not part of the main
stream of the traditional language, but a backwater
or a side stream. There have been
dozens of such private streams in the course of
our literary history, and I am not denying for
an instant that their final contribution to the
main stream has been considerable.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch42"><span class="smcap">The Decline of Free Intelligence.</span>—Pure
intelligence I should define as displaying
itself in disinterested interest in things; in
things, that is to say, of no <i>personal</i> advantage,
but only of general, public, or universal importance.
Interest (to turn the cat in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
pan) is the growing end of the mind, and its
direction and strength are marked by a motiveless
curiosity to know; it reveals itself, while
it is still active, as a love of knowledge for
its own sake. Later on it often appears that
this motiveless love had a motive; in other
words, the knowledge acquired under its impulse
is discovered in the end to “come in
handy,” and to have been of use. But the
process of acquiring this knowledge is for the
most part, indeliberate, unaware of any other
aim than that of the satisfaction of curiosity;
utility is remote from its mind. This is what
I have called disinterested interest, and it is
this free intelligence of which it appears to
me that there is a diminishing amount in our
day. Were it not the case, the fortunes of
the really free Press would be much brighter
than they are. An organ of free opinion
would not need to discover a utilitarian attraction
for its free opinions, but would be
able to command a sale on its own merits.
Such, indeed, is the case in several European
countries, notably in France, Italy, and Germany.
I am told that it is the case also in
Bohemia (in which country there is not only no
illiterate, but no un-read adult) and in the
provinces of Yugo Slavia. In these countries
a journal of opinions can live without providing
its readers with any commercial or
specialist bribe in the way of exclusive utilitarian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
information; it can live, that is to say,
by the sale of its free intelligence. Happy
countries—in one sense of the word; happy
if also tragical; for their existence is not
always, at any rate, a paradise for the rich,
a hell for the poor, and a purgatory for the
able!</p>

<p>To what is due this decline amongst us of
free intelligence? There are several explanations
possible, though none is wholly satisfying.
It can be attributed to the industrialisation
of our own country, a metamorphosis
of occupation which has been longer in being
in England than anywhere else. The economic
balance between primary and secondary production
has been for a longer period lost in
this country than elsewhere, with the consequence
that we have been the first to exhibit
the effects of over-industrialisation in the loss
of the free intelligence associated with primary
production. The other nations may be expected
to follow suit as the same metamorphosis
overtakes them. Another explanation
is the reaction against the intellectualism of
the nineteenth century. It is a familiar topic,
but it is obvious that if faith in the ultimate
<i>use</i> of intelligence is lost, men become cynical
in regard to the passion itself. Let us suppose
that every love affair always and invariably
ended in disappointment or disaster. Let us
suppose that it became the accepted belief that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
such would always be the case. Would it not
soon become fashionable to nip the first
stirrings of love in the bud, and to salt its path
whenever its shoots began to appear? The
nineteenth century reached its climax in a
vast disappointment with science, with the intellect,
with intellectualism. The fifth act of
the thrilling drama inaugurated after the
French Revolution closed in utter weariness
and ennui. It was no wonder that the
twentieth century opened in a return to impulse
and in a corresponding reaction from
intellectuality. That the reaction has gone too
far is the very disease we are now trying to
diagnose; for only an excessive reaction
towards impulse and away from thought can
account for the poverty of free intelligence.
Sooner or later, the pendulum must be set free
again, if not in this country, then in America,
or in some of the countries whose rebirth
we are now witnessing. It cannot be the will
of God that free intelligence should be extinguished
from the planet; the world,
somehow or other, must be made safe for
intelligence as well as for democracy.</p>

<p>My last guess at the origin of the phenomenon
is the decline of the religious spirit.
Religion, I conceive, is the study and practice
of perfection, and it is summed up in the text:
“Be ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven
is perfect.” This impossible and infinite aim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
includes, as a matter of course, the employment
and development of intelligence as one of the
most powerful aids to perfection. Fools, the
Indian Scriptures inform us, can enter heaven,
but only wise men know how to stay there.
And if the perfection we seek is to be lasting
and incorruptible, it is certain that an infinite
amount of intelligence will be necessary
to its accomplishment. The loss of the belief
in the perfectibility of the human spirit, in
the religious duty of perfection, might easily
account for the diminution of our regard for
one of the chief instruments of perfection,
namely, intelligence. Why should we strive
to set the crooked straight, since it is not
only impossible, but is no duty of ours? And
why labour with the instrumental means when
the end is of no value? None of these
explanations, however, really satisfies me.</p>

<p>The free Press is more severely criticised by
its readers than the “kept” Press by its
clientèle. The reason is, no doubt, that in
comparison with the “kept” Press it protests
its freedom and sets itself up on a pedestal.
Every “excuse” is consequently denied to it,
and the smallest complaint is enlarged to a
grievance. The “kept” Press may be caught
in flagrant self-contradiction, in lies, in
chicanery of all kinds, in every form of intellectual
and other dishonesty—it continues to
be read and “followed” as if the oracle were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
infallible. No newspaper in this country has
ever died of exposure; many live by being
found out. The free Press, on the other hand,
has often for its readers not only the most
exigent of critics, but the most contradictory.
They are not only hard to please (which is a
merit), but their reasons for being pleased,
or the reverse, are bewilderingly various.
And, moreover, when they are pleased they
are usually silent, and when they are displeased
they cease to buy the journal.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch43"><span class="smcap">Literary Copyright in America.</span>—Horace
Walpole used to say that the Americans
were the only people by whom he would
wish to be admired. Let me put the compliment
a little differently and say that the
Americans are the people among all others
whom we would most wish to admire most.
Having done so much to command our admiration
already, we are not only willing, we are
desirous and anxious, that they should leave
no amendable fault unamended in themselves.
Our command to them is that they should
become perfect.</p>

<p>This must be my excuse for joining in the
discussion concerning the law of literary copyright
in America, and the effect it has on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
literary relations of this country and America.
I must agree with Mr. Pound that the literary
relations of our two countries are bad, and that
much of this estrangement, if not all of it,
is due to remediable causes lying at present
on the American book of statutes. The actual
facts of the situation are simple. The copyright
laws of America, unlike those of any
other civilised country, with the exception of
ex-Tsarist Russia, require as a condition of
extending the protection of its copyright to
any work of foreign publication, that the latter
shall be set up, printed, and published in
America within a period of thirty to sixty days
after its publication in the country of its origin.
Failing such practically simultaneous publication
in America, not only is an American
publisher thereafter entitled to proceed immediately
to publish the work in question without
the permission of the author, but the author
and his national publisher are not entitled to
demand any royalties or fees on the sale of
the same. In other words, as far as the
original author and publisher are concerned,
they are non-existent in America unless they
have made arrangements for the publication of
their work in America within one, or, at most,
two months of its original publication in their
own country.</p>

<p>Not to exaggerate in describing such a procedure
it can be exactly characterised by no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
other phrase than looting under the form of
law. Every author and publisher in this
country knows how difficult it is to arrange
for the simultaneous publication of works at
home and in America. The time-conditions
of publication are seldom the same in both
countries. A book that is timely in this
country may not be simultaneously timely in
America, and it would be very odd if it always
were.</p>

<p>Again, a couple of months is a small period
of time in which to arrange to have an English
work dispatched, accepted, set up, printed, and
published in America. Commercial difficulties
of all kinds arise in the course of the transaction,
and every delay brings the day of the
accursed shears of the American Copyright Act
nearer. Is an English publisher to bargain
with the advantage of time always on the side
of America, with the certain knowledge that,
unless he comes to terms at once, he will lose
everything both for himself and his author?
But either that or indefinitely delaying publication
in <i>this</i> country is his only possible
course. The American Copyright Law is thus
seen to be a modern example of Morton’s fork.
By requiring that the foreign author shall publish
his work in America within one or two
months of its publication at home, the law
compels him to make a choice (in the majority
of cases) between forfeiting his copyright in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
America, and delaying, at his own cost, the
publication of his book in his own country.
Upon either prong he is impaled. If he elects
for American publication he must forgo the
chance of the immediate market at home, and
if he elects for immediate publication at home
he must forgo the protection of American
copyright.</p>

<p>Such an ingenious device for Dick-Turpining
European authors cannot have been invented
and enforced without some presumed moral
justification. America cannot be conceived as
a willing party to the legislation of literary
piracy, and it was and is, no doubt, under some
cover of justification that the law was enacted
and now runs. The defence for it, I should
suppose, is the presumed necessity for protecting
the industry of book-making in America
on behalf of American authors, printers, and
publishers alike. Its defence, in short, is the
same defence that is set up for protection in
commercial matters in this country, namely,
the desirability of excluding foreign competition,
and of encouraging home-industry.
Against this defence, however, there is a great
deal to be said that ought to weigh with the
American people, and that ought to weigh in
their calculations as well as in their taste and
sense of right. For, as to the latter, I take it
that no American would undertake to defend
his Copyright Law on the principles either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of good taste or common justice. It cannot be
in conformity with good taste for the literary
artists of America to procure protection for
themselves by penalising their European
confrères, and it cannot be justice to rob a
European author of his copyrights, or to compel
him to delay his publication in Europe. These
admissions I take for granted, and the only
defence left is the calculation that such a
Copyright Act is good for the American
book-making interests.</p>

<p>If books were like other commodities, their
sale, like the sale of other commodities, would
fall under the economic law of diminishing
returns. Thereunder, as their supply increased,
the demand for books would tend to decrease,
as is the case with cotton, say, or wooden
spoons. And upon such an assumption there
might be some reason for prohibiting the free
importation of printed books, since the imported
articles would compete in the home market for
a relatively inelastic demand. But books, it is
obvious, are not a commodity in this sense of
the word. They do not <i>satisfy</i> demand, but
<i>stimulate</i> it, and their sale, therefore, does not
fall under the economic law of diminishing
returns, but under the very contrary, that of
increasing returns. Books, there is no doubt
of it, are the cause of books. New books do
not take the place of old books; nor do books
really compete, as a general rule, with each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
other. On the contrary, the more books there
are, the more are demanded and the more are
produced. The free importation of books is
not a means of contracting the home-production
of books; it is the very opposite, the
most effective means of stimulating home-production
to its highest possible degree. If I
were an American author, resident in America,
and concerned for the prosperity of the American
book-making profession, craft, and industry,
I should not be in the least disposed to thank
the American Copyright Law for the protection
it professes to give me. The appetite for
books, upon which appetite I and my craft
live, grows, I should say, by what it feeds on.
Addressing the Copyright Act as it now exists,
I should say to it: “In discouraging the free
importation of foreign books, and in alienating
the good-will of foreign authors and publishers,
you are robbing foreign authors (that is true),
but, much worse, you are depriving my public
of the stimulus necessary to its demand for
my books. Since we authors in America have
a vital interest in increasing literary demand,
and the more books the more demand is
created, our real protection lies in freely
importing books, and not in placing any
impediment in their way. Intending to help
us, you—the Copyright Law—are really our
enemy.” I cannot see what reply the Copyright
Law could make to this attack upon it by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
its protégés, and I believe, moreover, that if
they were to make it, the Law would soon be
amended.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch44"><span class="smcap">Right Criticism.</span>—To abandon the aim of
“finality” of judgment is to let in the jungle
into the cultivated world of art; it is to invite
Tom, Dick, and Harry to offer their opinions
as of equal value with the opinions of the
cultivated. It is no escape from this conclusion
to inquire into the “mentality” of the
critic and to attach importance to his judgment
as his mentality is or is not interesting.
In appraising a judgment I am not concerned
with the mentality, interesting or otherwise,
of the judge who delivers it. My concern is
not with him, but with the work before us;
nor is the remark to be made upon his verdict
the personal comment, “How interesting!”
but the critical comment, “How true!” or
“How false!” Personal preferences turn the
attention in the nature of the case from the
object criticised to the critic himself. The
method substitutes for the criticism of art the
criticism of psychology. In a word, it is not
art criticism at all.</p>

<p>It may be said that if we dismiss personal
preference as a criterion of art judgment, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
is either nothing left or only some “scientific”
standard which has no relevance to
æsthetics. It is the common plea of the idiosyncrats
that, inconclusive as their opinions
must be, and anything but universally valid,
no other method within the world of art is
possible. I dissent. A “final” judgment is
as possible of a work of art as of any other
manifestation of the spirit of man; there is
nothing in the nature of things to prevent men
arriving at a universally valid (that is, universally
accepted) judgment of a book, a picture,
a sonata, a statue or a building, any more than
there is to prevent a legal judge from arriving
at a right judgment concerning any other
human act; and, what is more, such judgments
of art are not only made daily, but in the end
they actually prevail and constitute in their
totality the tradition of art. The test is not
scientific, but as little is it merely personal.
Its essential character is simply that it is right;
right however arrived at, and right whoever
arrives at it. That the judge in question may
or may not have “studied” the history of the
art-work he is judging is a matter of indifference.
Neither his learning nor his natural
ignorance is of any importance. That he is
or is not notoriously this, that, or the other,
is likewise no concern. All that matters is
that his judgment, when delivered, should be
“right.” But who is to settle this, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
asked? Who is to confirm a right judgment
or to dispute a wrong one? The answer is
contained in the true interpretation of the misunderstood
saying, <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>.
The proof of right taste is that
there is no real dispute about its judgment;
its finality is evidenced by the cessation of
debate. The truth may be simply stated;
a judge—that is to say, a true judge—is he with
whom everybody is compelled to agree, not
because he says it, but because it is so.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch45"><span class="smcap">Man’s Survival of Bodily Death.</span>—What
the circulation of the <i>Quest</i> is I have
no idea, but it should be ten times greater.
Is there, however, a sufficiently large class of
cultured persons in England—in the Empire—in
the world? Assuming that the spread of
culture can be reckoned numerically as well as
qualitatively, can we pride ourselves on the
extension of culture while the number of free
intelligences is relatively decreasing? But how
does one know that this class is really on the
decrease? Only by the same means that we
judge the number of the curious lepidoptera
in any area—by holding a light up in the dark
and counting the hosts attracted by it. In the
case of the <i>Quest</i> there is no doubt whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
that a light is being held up in our darkness.
Its articles are upon the most exalted topics;
they are, for the most part, luminously written,
and their purity of motive may be taken for
granted. The <i>Quest</i> is the literary Platonic
Academy of our day. Yet it is seldom spoken
of in literary circles. We “good” are very
apathetic, and it is lucky for the devil that his
disciples are unlike us in this respect. They
see to it that everything evil shall flourish like
the bay-tree, while we allow the bays of the
intelligent to fade into the sere.</p>

<p>Mr. Mead contributes an article on a topic
which has not yet been exhausted, “Man’s
Survival of Bodily Death.” Mr. Randall is
not the first to deny “immortality” while
affirming an absolute morality, nor even the
first to attempt to explain religion without
recourse to a dogma of survival. The Sadducees
did it before him; and the Confucians
managed somehow or other to combine
ancestor-worship with a lively denial of their
continued existence. There is, moreover, an
ethical value in the denial which almost makes
the denial of survival an act of moral heroism.
For if a man can pursue the highest moral
aims without the smallest hope of personal
reward hereafter, and, still less, here, his disinterestedness
is obvious; he pursues virtue
as the pupil is enjoined in the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>
to act, namely, without hope or fear of fruit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
I am not of the heroic breed myself, and, in
any case, the problem is one of fact as well as
of moral discipline. It may be heroic to put the
telescope of truth to a deliberately blinded
eye, but unless you suspect yourself of being
unable to master the fact, I see no indispensable
virtue in its wilful denial. At all risks
to my morality I should prefer to keep my
weather-eye open for such evidences of survival
as may loom up behind the fog.</p>

<p>Premising that “no high religion can exist
which is not based on faith in survival,” Mr.
Mead proceeds to examine the two forms of
inquiry which conceivably promise conclusions:
the comparative study of the mystic philosophers
and their recorded religious experiences
in all ages, and the more material examination
of the spiritualistic phenomena of modern
psychical research. For himself, Mr. Mead has
chosen the former method, and I am interested
to observe his testimony, in a rare personal
statement, to the satisfaction, more or less, that
is possible from following this road. At the
same time, though without any experience in
the second method, Mr. Mead is explicitly of
the opinion that it is one that should be employed
by science with increasing earnestness.
The difficulties are tremendous, and as subtle
as they are considerable. Before survival can
be scientifically demonstrated, a host of working
hypotheses must be invented and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
discredited, and the utmost veracity will be
necessary in the students. With such facts
before us as telepathy, dissociated personality,
subconscious complexes, autosuggestion and
suggestion, the phenomena that superficially
point to survival may plainly be nothing of the
kind. Survival, in short, must be expected
to be about the last rather than the first
psychic fact to be scientifically established. The
student must, therefore, be exigent as well as
hopeful.</p>

<p>There is a third method from which we may
hope to hear one day something to our advantage—assuming
that the certain knowledge of
survival would be to mankind’s advantage—the
method of psycho-analysis. If psycho-analysis
of the first degree can make us acquainted with
the subconscious, why should not a psycho-analysis
of the second degree make us
acquainted with the super-conscious; and as
the language of the subconscious may be sleeping
dreams, the language of the super-conscious
may be waking visions. To return to Mr.
Mead’s article, an interesting account is contained
in it of a recent census taken in America
by Professor Leuba of the creeds of more or
less eminent men. The returns for the article
of faith in survival and immortality are curious,
not to say surprising. Of the eminent physicists
canvassed, 40 per cent. confessed their belief
in man’s survival of bodily death. Thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the percentage falls through the stages of historians
35 per cent., and sociologists 27 per
cent., to psychologists with the degraded percentage
of 9. It is a strange reversal of the
procession that might have been anticipated,
and it expresses, perhaps, the condition of real
culture in America. For that the physicists
should be the most hopeful class of scientists
in America, and the psychologists the most
hopeless is an indication that the best brains
in America are still engaged in physical
problems. The poor psychologists are scarcely
even hopeful of discovering anything.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch46"><span class="smcap">Beardsley and Arthur Symons.</span>—“Unbounded”
admiration is precisely what I
cannot feel for Aubrey Beardsley’s work, even
“within its own sphere.” I ought to say,
perhaps, “because of its sphere.” Pure
æsthetic is a matter for contemplation only,
and we should be prepared upon occasion to
suspend every other kind of judgment. Or,
would it not be true to say that the purely
æsthetic does itself suspend in the beholder
every other form of judgment or reaction—such
as the moral, the intellectual, and the practical?
A great tragedy, for instance, is a
kind of focus of the whole nature of man;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
every faculty is engaged in it, and all are
lifted up and transfigured into the pure
æsthetic of contemplation. But one is not
aware, in that case, of moral or other reservations;
one has not to apologise for the
experience by pretending that the “essentially
repulsive and diabolic decadence” contained in
the tragedy is merely an expression of the age.
Beardsley is only “something of a genius”
precisely because he failed to transfigure the
moral and other reactions of the spectator of
his work. He did not occupy the <i>whole</i> of
one’s mind. All the while that one’s æsthetic
sense was being led captive by his art, several
other of one’s senses were in rebellion. His
command (his genius, in short) was not “absolute,”
but only a quite limited monarchy. This
is not to deny that he was an artist; it is to
deny only that he was one of the greatest of
artists. Other artists owe him a greater debt
than the world at large. He was a great art-master,
but not a master of art. The doctrine
of Mr. Arthur Symons is dangerous. Juggling
with the terms good and evil is always
dangerous, since in a prestidigital exhibition
of them, one can so easily be made to look
like the other. <i>Demon est Deus inversus.</i> The
paradoxical truth about the matter, however,
is that evil is good only so long as it is
regarded as evil. The moment it is thought
of as good it is nothing but evil. Mr. Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Symons has confused in his mind the problem
of good and evil with the quite alien problem
of quantity of energy.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch47"><span class="smcap">“Æ’s” “Candle of Vision.”</span>—“Æ’s”
<i>Candle of Vision</i> is not a book for everybody,
yet I wish that everybody might read it.
Rarely and more rarely does any artist or poet
interest himself in the processes of his mental
and spiritual life, with the consequence, so
often deplored by Mr. Penty, that books on
æsthetics, philosophy, and, above all, psychology,
are left to be written by men who
have no immediate experience of what they
are writing of. “Æ’s” narrative, and criticism
of his personal experiences may be said to
take the form of intimate confessions made
<i>pour encourager les autres</i>. For, happily for
us, he is an artist who is also a philosopher,
a visionary who is also an “intellectual”;
and, being interested in both phases of his
personality, he has had the impulse and the
courage to express both. What the ordinary
mind—the mind corrupted by false education—would
say to “Æ’s” affirmations concerning
his psychological experiences, it would not
be difficult to forecast. What is not invention,
it would be said, is moonshine, and
what is neither is a pose to be explained on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
some alienist hypothesis. Only readers who
can recall some experiences similar to those
described by “Æ” will find themselves able
to accept the work for what it is—a statement
of uncommon fact; and only those who have
developed their intuition to some degree will
be able to appreciate the spirit of truth in
which the <i>Candle of Vision</i> is written. A
review of such work is not to be undertaken
by me, but I have made a few notes on some
passages.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 2. “<i>I could not so desire what was
not my own, and what is our own we cannot
lose.... Desire is hidden identity.</i>” This is
a characteristic doctrine of mysticism, and
recurs invariably in all the confessions. Such
unanimity is an evidence of the truth of the
doctrine, since it is scarcely to be supposed that
the mystics borrow from one another. But
the doctrine, nevertheless, is difficult for the
mere mind to accept, for it involves the belief
that nothing happens to us that is not ourselves.
Character in that event is destiny—to
quote a variant of “Æ’s” sentence; and
our lives are thus merely the dramatisation of
our given psychology. Without presuming to
question the doctrine, I feel a reserve concerning
its absoluteness. Fate appears to me to
be above destiny in the same sense that the
old lady conceived that there was One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
above that would see that Providence did not
go too far. To the extent that character is
destiny or, as “Æ” says, desire is hidden
identity, a correct psychological forecast would
be at the same time a correct temporal forecast.
And while this may be true, in the
abstract and under, so to say, ideal conditions,
I cannot yet agree that everything that
happens to the individual is within his
character. The unforeseeable, the margin of
what we call Chance, allows for events that
belong to Fate rather than to Destiny.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 3. “Æ” says he “<i>was not conscious
in boyhood (up to the age of sixteen or seventeen)
of any heaven lying about me.</i>” “Childhood,”
he thinks, is no nearer the “eternally
young” than age may be. Certainly it
appears to be so in the case of “Æ” himself,
for the intimations of immortality which
Wordsworth (and the world in general) attributed
to children were only begun to be experienced
by “Æ” after his sixteenth or
seventeenth year. From that time onwards, as
this book testifies, he has been growing
younger in precisely those characteristics.
There is a good deal to be thought, if not
said, on this subject. Children are, I conceive,
rather symbols of youth than youth itself;
they are unconsciously young. Age, on the
other hand, has the power of converting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
symbol into the reality, and of being young and
knowing it. Unless ye become, <i>not</i> little
children, but <i>as</i> little children, ye shall in no
wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven. At the
same time it is comparatively rare for the
ordinary child, that “Æ” says he was, to
develop childlikeness in later life. Usually a
return occurs to a state unconsciously experienced
in early youth. But there appear
to be strata of characteristics in every mind,
and life is their successive revelation. Without
knowing anything of the facts, I surmise
that “Æ’s” heredity was mixed, and that the
first layer or stratum to appear was that of
some possibly Lowland Scot ancestry. When
that was worked through, by the age of sixteen,
another layer came to the surface, whereupon
“Æ” entered on another phase of
“desire.”</p>

<p class="tb">Page 7. “<i>We may have a personal wisdom,
but spiritual wisdom is not to speak of as
ours.</i>” This illustrates another characteristic
of the mystic that while his experiences are
personal, the wisdom revealed in them is always
attributed to “Him that taught me”—in other
words, to something not ourselves. An egoist
mysticism is a contradiction in terms. Not
only no man is entitled to claim originality
for a spiritual truth, but no man can. The
truth is no longer true when it has a name to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
it. “Truth bears no man’s name” is an axiom
of mysticism. The reason, I presume, is that
the very condition of the appreciation of a
spiritual truth is the absence of the sense of
egoism. Such truths are simply not revealed
to the egoistic consciousness, and therefore cannot
appear as the product of human wisdom.
Their character is that of a revelation from
without rather than that of a discovery from
within, and the report of the matter is thus
objective rather than subjective.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 16. “<i>I could prophesy from the uprising
of new moods in myself that without
search I should soon meet people of a certain
character, and so I met them.... I accepted
what befell with resignation.... What we
are alone has power.... No destiny other
than we make for ourselves.</i>” I have already
expressed my doubts whether this is the whole
truth. It is, of course, the familiar doctrine
of Karma; but I do not think it can be interpreted
quite literally. There is what is called
the Love of God, as well as the Justice of
God, and I would venture to add, with Blake,
the Wrath of God. Judgment is something
more than simple justice; it implies the consent
of the whole of the judging nature, and
not of its sense of justice only. Love enters
into it, and so, perhaps, do many other qualities
not usually attributed to the Supreme Judge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
In interpreting such doctrines we must allow
for the personal equation even of the highest
personality we can conceive.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 19. “<i>None needs special gifts of
genius.</i>” “Æ’s” <i>Candle of Vision</i> is confessedly
propagandist. It aims deliberately at
encouraging age to discover eternal youth, and
to lay hold of everlasting life. It is to this
end that “Æ” describes his own experiences,
and offers to his readers the means of their
verification. He is quite explicit that no
“special gifts” or “genius” are necessary.
“This do and ye shall find even as I have
found.” The special gift of genius does not,
I agree, lie in the nature of fact of the experience
(though here, again, favour seems
sometimes to be shown), but it does, I think,
lie in the bent towards the effort involved.
Anybody, it is true, may by the appropriate
means experience the same results, but not
everybody has the “desire” to employ them.
Desire, moreover, is susceptible of many degrees
of strength. Like other psychological
characteristics, it appears to peel off like the
skins of Peer Gynt’s onion. What is it that I
really desire? Ask me to-day, and I shall
answer one thing. Ask me next year, and
it may be another. Years hence it may have
changed again. But desire, in the mystical
sense, is the desire that is left when all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
transient wishes or fancies have either vanished
or been satisfied. Only such a desire leads
the student to make the effort required by
“Æ,” and the possession of such a desire
is something like a “special gift” or
“genius.”</p>

<p class="tb">Page 20. “<i>Our religions make promises to
be fulfilled beyond the grave, because they have
no knowledge now to be put to the test....
Mistrust the religion that does not cry out:
‘Test me that we can become as gods.’</i>” This
is an excellent observation, and accounts, to
my mind, for all the so-called scepticism of
modern times. It is usual to attribute to our
predecessors, the most remote as well as the
more recent, a quality of “faith” superior to
our own. They are said to have been more
religious than we are. I do not believe it;
or, rather, I believe that they were religious
because they had very good reason to be; in
other words, they were not only told the
mysteries, but they were shown them. Either
they or their priests had the “open vision.”
Is it conceivable that the primitive peoples had
the confidence-trick played on them? Or,
again, is it the fact that credulity is less to-day
than before? I feel sure that if our ancestors
were brought to belief, it was by means
which would equally carry conviction to the
present generation. To repeat myself: They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
believed because they were shown. “Æ”
suggests that the after-life promises of modern
religion are a substitute for or an invasion of
present demonstration. Religions, that is to
say, concentrate upon the invisible because their
power over the visible is gone. It is not
the fact, however, that the earlier religions ignored
the after-death adventures of the soul;
they were quite as much concerned with the
life beyond the grave as our own religions.
What they did, and what our religions fail
to do, was to give present guarantees for their
future promises. Their priests could procure
belief in the after-life on the strength of their
demonstrated power over this life. It is
probable, indeed, that many of the elect experienced
“death” before it occurred
physically. The Egyptian mysteries were a
kind of experimental death.</p>

<p>Page 21. Here and on the neighbouring
pages “Æ” expounds his method of meditation—the
means by which any “ordinary”
person may acquire spiritual experience.
“Æ’s” method follows the familiar line of
the mystic schools, namely, unwavering concentration
on some mental object. “Five
minutes of this effort,” “Æ” says, “will at
first leave us trembling as at the end of a
laborious day.” I can testify that this is no
exaggeration, for, like “Æ,” I have practised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
meditation after the methods prescribed. It is
no easy job, and after months of regular
practice I was still an amateur at the simplest
exercises. There is no doubt, however, about
the benefit of it. Much is learned in meditation
that cannot be realised by any other mental
exercise. The <i>mind</i> becomes a real organ,
as distinct from the personality as a physical
limb. And gradually one learns to acquire
sufficient control over it, if not to use it like a
master, at any rate, to realise that it <i>can</i> be
so used. I have not the smallest doubt that
one day men will be able to “use” their
minds, and thus to cease to be “used” by
them; for it is obvious that at present we
are victims rather than masters of our mind.
Meditation, as a means of mind-control, is the
appointed method, and “Æ’s” personal experience
should encourage his readers to take
up the discipline.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 41. In regard to “visions,” they are
usually dismissed by the commonalty as products
of imagination, “as if,” says “Æ,”
“imagination were as easily explained as a
problem in Euclid.” This habit of referring
one mystery to another, as if this latter were
no mystery, is very common; and it arises,
no doubt, from intellectual apathy. We cannot
be bothered to reduce mysteries to knowledge,
and, moreover, the realisation that literally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
everything is a mystery, that we simply live in
mystery, is a little disconcerting. Hence our
preference for assuming some things, at any
rate, to be below the need of explanation.
Imagination, however, provides us with no
escape from the mysteries of vision, any more
than matter provides us with an escape from
the problems of spirit. “Æ” raises some
difficult, and, probably, insoluble problems concerning
imagination itself. <i>What</i> is it in us
that imagines? <i>How</i> does it cast thoughts
into form? Even allowing (which we cannot)
that imagination is only “the re-fashioning of
memory,” what re-fashions and transforms out
of their original resemblance the memories of
things seen? “Æ” has had many visions,
some of which, no doubt, he could trace to
recollected impressions; but, leaving aside once
more the difficulty involved in this reconstruction,
what of the visions that had, or appeared
to have, no earthly progenitors? “Æ’s” conclusion
appears to be indisputable, that “we
swim in an æther of deity”—for “in Him
we live and move and have our being.”</p>

<p>Passim. Is it possible that telepathy occurs
between people having the same mental “wavelength”?
Coincidences (another Mesopotamian
word, by the way) are too frequent to be
accountable on any other supposition than that
of an established communication. Like many
another, I could give some remarkable instances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of telepathy, but they would be tedious
to relate. Mental training, however, is certainly
a means to this end; for in proportion
as the mind is brought under control, its
susceptibility to thoughts from outside palpably
increases. The experience of the Old Testament
prophet who knew the plans of the enemy
before they were uttered is not unique, even
in these days. It will be far less uncommon
in the days to come.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 54. “<i>Is there a centre within us
through which all the threads of the universe
are drawn?</i>” An ingenious image for a recurrent
doctrine of mysticism, the doctrine,
namely, that everything is everywhere. One
of the earliest discoveries made in meditation
is the magnitude of the infinitesimal. The
tiniest point of space appears to have room
enough for a world of images; and the
mediæval discussion concerning the number of
angels that could dance on the point of a
needle was by no means ridiculous. If I am
not mistaken, “Æ’s” problem is identical
with it.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 89. The Architecture of Dreams. In
this chapter “Æ” sets himself to casting some
doubts (shall we say?) on the sufficiency of
the Freudian theory of dreams. Dreams, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
to Freud, are the dramatisation of suppressed
desires; but what, asks “Æ,” is
the means by which desires, suppressed or
otherwise, dramatise themselves? “A mood
or desire may <i>attract</i> its affinities”; in other
words, there may be a congruity between the
desire and the dream which serves the Freudian
purpose of interpretation; but desire can hardly
be said “to <i>create</i> what it attracts.” Between
anger, for instance, and a definite vision of
conflict, such as the dream may represent, there
is a gulf which the theory of Freud does not
enable us to cross. What, in fact, <i>are</i> dreams?
<i>Who</i> or <i>what</i> carries out the dramatisation?
Assuming, with Freud, that their impulse is a
desire, what power shapes this desire into the
dream-cartoon? “Æ” throws no light on the
mystery, but, at any rate, he does not dismiss
it as no mystery at all. Its philosophical discussion
is to be found in the Indian philosophy
known as the Sankhya.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 89. “<i>The process must be conscious
on some plane</i>”—the dramatisation, that is to
say, must be the conscious work of some intelligent
agent or quality. I am a little doubtful
of this, for reasons to be discovered in
the Sankhya philosophy just referred to. Is
the pattern taken by sand on a shaken plate
a “conscious” design? Are frost-flowers the
work of intelligence? Forms, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Sankhya, are the reflection in matter (Prakriti)
of the activities of the spirit (Purusha);
they are consciousness visible. But it would
not follow that they are themselves conscious
or that their creation is a “conscious”
process.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 90. “Have imaginations body?”
In other words, are the figures seen in dream
and vision three-dimensional? “Æ” describes
several incidents within his experience that certainly
seem to suggest an objective reality in
dream-figures, and the occasional projection of
dream-figures into phantasms is a further
evidence of it. But, once again, I would refer
“Æ” to the Sankhya aphorisms, and to
Kapila’s commentary on them. The question
is really of the general order of the relation
of form to thought.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 114. Here, and in the succeeding
essay, “Æ” develops his intuitional thesis that
sound and thought have definite affinities. For
every thought there is a sound, and every sound
is at the same time a thought. The idea is, of
course, familiar, and, like many more in the
<i>Candle of Vision</i>, is found recurring like a
decimal throughout mystical and occult literature
in all ages. The most ancient occult
literature—dispute whether that of India or
Egypt—is most precise on the subject, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
general proposition being therein reduced to
a series of equivalents in which form, sound,
colour, thought, emotion, and number, all seem
to be interchangeable. Each of these, in fact,
is said to be a language—a complete language;
and to the initiate it is a matter of indifference
whether the text before him is “written” in
form, in colour, in number, or sound. Unfortunately,
neither “Æ” nor anybody within
our knowledge, is able to procure even the
skeleton key to the mystery. The records are
so perversely confused that I cannot believe
that their authors were not deliberately playing
a game with us. It would be rather like the
old initiates to “dis” their type before leaving
it to be examined by the barbarian invaders;
and certainly nobody of ordinary
faculty can begin to make head or tail of the
“correspondences” recorded in the Indian
scriptures. It is the same, strangely enough,
with Plato, whose <i>Cratylus</i> deals with the relation
of verbal language to mental conception.
A master of simple exposition, he becomes in
the <i>Cratylus</i>, whether from design or feebleness
of understanding, as cryptic as the Indians
themselves. I have read the <i>Cratylus</i> all ways,
with no better result than to feel that I have
wasted my time. “Æ” has approached the
problem, however, experimentally, with the aid
of his intuition. If, he said to himself, there
is really a definite correspondence between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
sound and idea, meditation on one or the other
should be able to discover it. In other words,
he has attempted to re-discover the lost
language, and to find for himself the key whose
fragments bestrew the ancient occult works.
This again, however, is no novelty, but another
of the recurrent ideas of mystics and would-be
occultists. All of them have tried it, but,
unfortunately, most of them come to different
conclusions. “Æ’s” guesses must, therefore,
be taken as guesses only, to be compared with
the guesses of other students.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 132. One of the features of the
<i>Candle of Vision</i> is the occasional ray cast by
“Æ” upon the obscure texts of the Bible.
The Bible, of course, is for the most part unmistakably
“occult”; and not only its stories
are myths (“which things are an allegory”),
but many of its texts are echoes of a gnosis
infinitely older than the Christian era. Greece,
it has now been established, was an infant
when Egypt was old; and Egypt, in its turn,
was an infant when some civilisation anterior
to it was in its dotage. The Bible is a kind
of ark, in which were stored (without much
order, I imagine) some of the traditions of
the world that was about to be submerged.
They can be brought to life again, however,
and here and there, in the course of the
<i>Candle of Vision</i>, “Æ” undoubtedly rejuvenates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
a Biblical text, and restores to it its
ancient meaning. “He made every flower
before it was in the field, and every herb before
it grew.” This points, says “Æ,” to the
probability that the Garden of Eden was the
“Garden of the Divine Mind,” in which flowers
and herbs and all the rest of creation lived
before they were made—visible! Such a conception
is very illuminating. Moreover, it
brings the story of Genesis into line with the
genesis stories of both ancient India and the
most recent psychology. For modern psycho-analysis,
in the researches of Jung in particular,
is undoubtedly trembling on the brink of the
discovery of the divine mind which precedes
visible creation. The process is indissolubly
linked up with the psychology of imagination,
phantasm, and vision.</p>

<p class="tb">Page 137. On Power. “<i>If we have not
power we are nothing, and must remain outcasts
of Heaven.</i>” In this chapter “Æ”
shakes the fringes of the most dangerous
subject in the world, that of the acquisition of
“spiritual” power. I put the word under
suspicion, because while in the comparative
sense spiritual, the powers here spoken of may
be anything but beneficent. The instructions to
be found in, let us say, Patanjali, are full of
warnings against the acquisition of occult
powers before the character of the student is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
“purified.” We are a long way, of course,
from the plane of conventional goodness in the
use of this word purity. The conventionally
good may have all the characteristics of the
black magician (so-called) when he finds himself
in the possession of power. Purity, in the
sense implied, connotes non-attachment, and
non-attachment, again, implies the non-existence
of any personal desire—even for the good.
Nietzsche died before he began to understand
himself. His pre-occupation with the problem
of power was undoubtedly an occult exercise;
and his discovery that spiritual power needs to
be exercised “beyond good and evil,” was
a hint of the progress he had made. Unfortunately
for Nietzsche, his <i>Beyond Good and
Evil</i> was still not clear of the element of
egotism; he carried into the occult world the
attachment and the desire that emphatically belong
to the world of both Good and Evil. In
short, he attempted to take Heaven by egoistic
storm, and his defeat was a foregone conclusion
and a familiar tragedy in occult history.
“Æ,” like his authorities, is full of warning
against the quest of power. At the same time,
like them, he realises that without power the
student can do nothing. Here is the paradox,
the mightiest in psychology, that the weakest
is the strongest and the strongest the weakest.
I commend this chapter to Nietzscheans in
particular. They have most to learn from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p class="tb">Page 153 et seq. “Æ” makes an attempt
to systematise “Celtic cosmogony.” It appears
to me to be altogether premature, and of as
little value as the “interpretation” of Blake’s
cosmogony, which Messrs. Yeats and Ellis
formerly attempted. Celtic cosmogony, as
found in Irish legend and tradition, may be
a cosmogony, and perhaps one of the oldest
in the world (for Ireland is always with us!).
But the fragmentary character of the records,
the absence of any living tradition in them,
coupled with the difficulty of re-interpretation
in rational terms, make even “Æ’s” effort a
little laborious. There is little illumination in
the <i>Candle</i> when it becomes an Irish bog-light.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch48"><span class="smcap">How to Read.</span>—The greatest books are
only to be grasped by the total understanding
which is called intuition. As an aid to the
realisation of the truth, we may fall back upon
the final proofs of idiom and experience.
Idiom is the fruit of wisdom on the tree of
language; and experience is both the end and
the beginning of idiom. What more familiar
idiom is there than that which expresses the
idea and the experience of reading a book “between
the lines”; reading, in fact, what is not
there in the perception of our merely logical
understanding? And what, again, is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
familiar than the experience of “having been
done good” by reading a great, particularly a
great mystical or poetical work, like the Bible
or Milton; still more, by reading such works
as the <i>Mahabharata</i>? Idiom and experience
do not deceive us. The “subconscious” of
every great book is vastly greater than its
conscious element, as the “subconscious” of
each of us is many times richer in content
than our conscious minds. Reading between
the lines, resulting often and usually in a sense
of illuminated bewilderment difficult to put
into words, is in reality intuitional reading;
the subconscious in the reader is put into relation
with the subconscious of the writer. Deep
communicates with deep. No “interpretation”
of an allegorical kind need result from
it. We may be unable at once to put into
words any of the ideas we have gathered.
Patience! The truths thus grasped will find
their way to the conscious mind, and one day,
perhaps, to our lips.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch49"><span class="smcap">The Old Country.</span>—A country may grow
aged in mind long before it is really old in
history, and it may be the case with England
that long before she is old in history her mind
is becoming aged. The peculiarity of the aged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
mind is not that it cannot think, but that it
cannot think new thoughts. All its energy
runs in grooves, and there is none to spare
for the cutting of a new road into new ideas.
There is little and less “free mind” in
England. Like the commons and the commonwealth,
all the mind-energy has been appropriated
by one interest or another, with the
consequence that every fresh idea is compelled
either to starve at home or to emigrate abroad.
America, as an intellectually youthful nation
(may it never grow aged!) reaps the advantage
of the decline of its aged parent. Ideas that
cannot pick up a living in this country, owing
to the appropriations of energy already made,
may emigrate to America and flourish there.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch50"><span class="smcap">Looking for the Dawn.</span>—The Spring
issue of <i>Art and Letters</i> has been long enough
out to have had its run for its money. Consequently
I am free to say that it is not only
not so good as the first issue, but that the
descent has been steep as well as rapid. This
decline from the almost sublime to the more
than ridiculous was inevitable from the peculiar
characteristics of our immediately contemporary
epoch; for it is the sober truth that our contemporary
world does not supply youthful stuff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
enough to make more than a single issue of a
literary magazine of high pretension. I have
looked about me with the eye of an eagle
and the appetite of a raven to discover youthful
talent possibly budding into genius. A few
sprigs and sprays have fallen within my vision,
and I have counted myself recompensed for
hours and years of trouble. But at this present
moment such apparitions and premonitions of
the future are fewer than ever I have known
them to be. Whether it is that more than
individual—<i>collective</i> talent—has fallen in the
war; whether the increasing pre-occupation
of men’s minds with economics has proportionately
impoverished the will to literature of
our young men; or whether a critical taste is
losing generosity, the number of fresh talents
just being committed to us appears utterly
unequal to the unequalled opportunity for
employing them. There never was a time
when it was easier for a young writer to find
publication in one form or another. The
number of new magazines projected and issued
recently has been legion. I have examined
most of them; for it is my hobby to collect
the earliest specimens, and it is my unpleasant
opinion that most of them would be better for
never having been born.</p>

<p>They manage, or, at any rate, they are
beginning to manage these things better in
America. That America is the country of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
future is open to less doubt as a prophecy
when the critic has made acquaintance with
the new and renewed magazines now appearing
in that country. A tone of provinciality still
dominates a considerable part of the American
literary Press, but it is obvious that tremendous
efforts are being made to recover or, let us
say, to discover centrality. American literary
editors are more and more aiming to interest
the world of readers rather than a mere
province of them. I need scarcely say that
the world of readers is not the same thing as
a world of readers. A world of readers connotes
large numbers, consisting chiefly of
readers in search of amusement; but the world
of readers consists of the few in every country
who really read for their living, or rather,
for their lives. To appeal to the latter class
is to be “of the centre,” for the centre of
every movement of life is not only the most
vital, it is the smallest element, of the whole.
The most recent American literary journals
appear to me to be endeavouring to become
organs for this class of reader. It is not indicated
more plainly in the fact that they are
enlisting European writers than in the fact
that their American contributors are writing
to be read in Europe as well as in America.
America has begun to discover Europe.
America is on the way to absorb Europe. In
the course of a few generations, if the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
American magazines may be taken as indicating
direction, European writers will be as intelligible
in America as in Europe; and, perhaps,
more so.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch51"><span class="smcap">Fielding for America.</span>—It is very doubtful
whether anybody reads Fielding nowadays.
Nevertheless, like all the eighteenth century
writers, he is more than worth all the time
we waste on certain contemporaries. There
is nothing of the “damned literary” about
Fielding; but also there is nothing of what
usually goes with the absence of letters, sentimentality.
Fielding’s letters, one feels, were
absorbed into his blood; they did not remain
like crumbs on the lips after a barbarian repast.
Fielding could carry his letters as his contemporaries
boasted they could carry their port—without
showing it. And it was no less the
case that he carried his feelings with the same
well-bred ease, without displaying them, and,
even more, without permitting them to rule his
intelligence. Richardson seems born to have
provoked Fielding to write. He incarnated
everything that Fielding thought worth a negative.
But for Richardson, Fielding would
possibly have never found his true <i>métier</i>;
Richardson was his twin opposite. Fielding,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
however, must always pay the penalty of being
a reactionary, of requiring a stimulant; he
is no creator, for the stuff of creation was not
native to him. He is an amusing <i>causeur</i> with
his eye always upon Richardson; a man of the
world telling a story <i>à la</i> Richardson, but
with the explanations common to the class of
English gentlemen. He is put among the
English <i>Men of Letters</i> in the series edited
by Lord Morley, and now he is receiving
attention in America. America needs Fielding;
for what is America in danger of becoming
but a kind of Richardson continent? Our
eighteenth century writers are a school to which
American literature must go as a means of
escape from the Roundhead tradition which
otherwise America will scarcely succeed in
overpassing. I cannot conceive, however, that
<i>Tom Jones</i> will be popular in America yet
awhile. He has more resistance to encounter
there than in any other civilised nation. But
until <i>Tom Jones</i> can be read in America
without a blush, American literature will remain
several centuries behind English and European
literature.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch52"><span class="smcap">Poor Authors!</span>—Is it a fact that the dearness
of literature alone or mainly restricts its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
sale? Is it certain that either cheap publication
or (what amounts to the same thing) a generous
diffusion of money among the masses would
ensure the success of, let us say, good first
novels—in the present state of public taste?
We have had some experience both of cheapness
and of the diffusion of money. Publication
was cheap enough before the war in all
conscience. New novels could be brought out
for a shilling. Was it the common experience
that the best of them proved a commercial
success? The best of them were nine times
out of ten a commercial failure. And in
respect of the diffusion of money, what has
been our experience of the direction in which
the diffused money has been spent? Have
the masses accumulated libraries? Have they
patronised the arts? Have they encouraged
literature with discriminating taste? Have they
sought out and bought the young authors, the
promising writers, the writers of to-morrow?
We know they have done nothing of the kind.
The diffused money has fallen, for the most
part, into two sets of hands, the hands of the
ignorant profiteers and the hands of the
ignorant masses. And both classes have
neglected literature in favour of sports and
furs, display and amusement. It is idle to
pretend that things are other than they are.
We need not necessarily be discouraged by
the fact, but it is necessary to recognise the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
facts. And the facts in the present case are
that the people who have the money (much
or little) do not care a shilling for literature
and accept no responsibility for its existence.
Their <i>excuse</i> for the moment is that literature
is too dear; but it would be all the same if
it were cheap. I have never observed that
rich or poor have complained that their sports
and amusements are too dear. Nobody appeals
to cinema-proprietors or yachting entrepreneurs
to pity their clients and ruin themselves commercially.
When the public wants literature
as much as it wants to be entertained, there
will be no need for anybody’s charity.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, what is the young writer
to do? In particular, the young novelist? He
appears to be about to be among the most
miserable of mankind. To be published and
to be a commercial failure is bad enough in
a country like our own, where a <i>succès d’estime</i>
is almost a certificate for pity. But not to
be published at all is infinitely worse. Instead
of appealing to commercial publishers, however,
is it not possible to appeal to the Guild
of Authors, to the fraternity whose function
and responsibility are the creation and encouragement
of literature? Who should be patrons
of literature if not men of letters themselves?
And whose duty should it be, if not that of
novelists as a guild, to secure the succession
and to provide for the future princes? If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
publishers are willing to assume the burdens of
literature—always heavy in proportion to the
ignorance of the public—let them by all means.
So much the more honour to them. But the
proper shoulders for the burden, in the absence
of an enlightened public, are the shoulders of
the Guild of Letters, the shoulders, in particular,
of the <i>successful</i> men. There is no
lack of money among them. I should roughly
calculate that the income of our successful
novelists is more than equal to that of all our
publishers put together. Why should they not
subsidise literature? Why, out of their abundance,
should they not set aside a portion for
their literary posterity?</p>

<p class="section" id="ch53"><span class="smcap">On Guard.</span>—As one of the thirty thousand
who take in and occasionally read <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>, I may draw attention to
the danger to truth its composite character is
always creating. Being familiar with the back-ways
of publishing I am not taken in, of course,
by the uniform use of the editorial “we” in
a journal like <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>.
“We” represents a score of different people,
all or most of whom are as much at intellectual
sixes and sevens as any other score; and the
editor-in-chief, whoever he may be, is just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
as powerless as a sovereign is over its twenty
shillings. That being granted, the situation
is still a little strange from the fact that certain
sentiments are allowed to appear in the <i>Literary
Supplement</i> which, to say the least, are incongruous
with <i>The Times</i> and all <i>The Times</i>
stands for. Here, for instance, are three quotations
from recent issues: “Whether you beat
your neighbour by militarism or buy him by
industrialism—the effect is the same.” “That
most false and nauseating of legends—‘the
happy warrior.’” “The organisation of trade
is of secondary moment: what is of the first
moment is the organisation of a humane enjoyment
of its benefits.” These sentiments are
true, and they are sufficiently strikingly put.
But in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> they are
not only incongruous, but they are in a very
subtle sense actually lies, and the more
dangerous lies from their identity with the
truth. It is one of the paradoxes of truth that
a statement is only true when it is in truthful
company. As the corruption of the best is
the worst, so evil communications corrupt good
statements, and a truth in bad company is the
worst of lies. It is a mystery not easily to be
understood, but the intuition may, perhaps,
make something of it. Is it not the fact that
the occurrence of statements like those just
quoted in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>
causes a feeling of nausea? On examining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
the cause it will be found to lie in the
unconscious realisation that such statements are
there made for no good purpose, but are only
decoy ducks for the better snaring of our
suffrages for the real policy of <i>The Times</i>
itself.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch54"><span class="smcap">The Coming Renaissance.</span>—The prognostication
of the approach of a new Renaissance
has quite naturally been received with incredulity.
Is it not the fact that civilisation is in
a thoroughly morbid condition bordering on
hysteria, and was ever the outlook for culture
darker than it is at this moment? I have just
been discussing the subject with a friend who
laid this evidence before me with a touch of
reproach: how <i>could</i> I, in the face of such
a circle of gloom, pretend that we were even
possibly (which is all I affirm) on the eve of
a new Renaissance? My explanation of this
part of the story is, however, quite simple.
The war has precipitated a development in
external events <i>faster</i> than the average mind has
been able to adapt itself to them, with the
consequence that the average mind has had
to take refuge in hysteria. For the greater
part of hysteria is due to nothing more than
an inadequacy of the mind to a given situation;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and when the situation as given to-day is a
situation that should and would, but for the
war, have arisen only, let us say, twenty years
hence, there is no wonder that in the mass of
the slowly developing minds of our people an
inadequacy to the occasion should be experienced
or that the result should appear as
hysteria. On the other hand, hysteria is not
a stable condition of the mind; it is a transition
to a more complete adaptation to reality,
or, in the alternative, to complete disintegration.
But what is to be expected from the
present situation? Not, surely, disintegration
in the general sense, though it may take place
in individual cases, but a forward movement in
the direction of adaptation. This forward
movement is the Renaissance, and it is thus
from the very circumstances of gloom and
hysteria that we may draw the hope that a
fresh advance of the human spirit is about to
be made.</p>

<p>It is significant that concurrently with such
a social diagnosis as anyone may make, special
observers, with or without a bee in their bonnet,
are arriving at the same conclusion. There are
very confident guesses now being disseminated
by the various religious and mystic schools
concerning what, in their vocabulary, they call
the Second Advent—which, however, may
well be the seven hundredth or the seven
thousandth for all we know. Attach no importance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
if you like, to the phenomena in
question, but the fact of the coincidence of
forecast is somewhat impressive; for while
it is absurd to believe the “Second Adventists”
of all denominations when they stand alone in
their prognostications, their testimony is not
negligible when it is supported by what amounts
to science. And the fact is that to-day science,
no less than mysticism, is apprehensive of a
New Coming of some kind or other. What the
nature of that New Coming is likely to be, and
when or how it will manifest itself, are matters
beyond direct knowledge, but the ear of science,
no less than the ear of mysticism, is a little
thrilled with the spirit of expectation.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch55"><span class="smcap">Leonardo da Vinci as Pioneer.</span>—Leonardo
da Vinci’s name has been frequently
mentioned among the intelligent during the
last few years, and it cannot be without a
meaning. It may be said that his reappearance
as a subject for discussion is due to a
fortuitous concurrence of publishers. But accidents
of this kind are like miracles: they do
not happen; and I, for one, am inclined to
suspect the “collective unconscious” of a
design in thrusting forward at this moment
the name and personality of the great Renaissance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
humanist. What can we guess the design
to be? What is the interpretation of this
prominent figure in our current collective
dreams? The symbols appearing in dreams
are the expressive language of the unconscious
mind, and the appearance of the symbol of
da Vinci is or may be an indication that the
“unconscious” is “dreaming” of a new
Renaissance. And since the dreams of the
unconscious to-day are or may be the acts
of the conscious to-morrow, the prevalent
interest in Leonardo is a further possible piece
of evidence that we are or may be on the eve
of a recurrence of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>Leonardo as an artist interests us less than
Leonardo as a person. That is not to say that
Leonardo was not a great artist, for, of course,
he was one of the greatest. But it is to say
that the promise of which he was an incarnation
was even greater than the fulfilment which
he achieved. There is a glorious sentence in
one of the Upanishads which is attributed to
the Creator on the morrow of His completion
of the creation of the whole manifested
universe. “Having pervaded all this,” he says,
“I remain.” Not even the creation of the
world had exhausted His powers or even so
much as diminished His self-existence. When
that greatest of works of art had been accomplished,
He, the Creator, “remained.”
Leonardo was, if I may use the expression,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
a chip of the original block in this respect.
His works, humanly speaking, were wonderful;
they were both multitudinous and various.
Nevertheless, after the last of them had been
performed, Leonardo remained as a great
“promise,” still unfulfilled. That is the
character of the Renaissance type, as it is also
the character of a Renaissance period; its
promise remains over even after great accomplishment.
The Renaissance man is greater
than his work; he pervades his work, but he
is not submerged in it.</p>

<p>I should be trespassing on the domain of
the psycho-analysts if I were to attempt to
indicate the <i>means</i> by which a collective
hysteria may be resolved into an integration.
Taking the Italian Renaissance, however, as a
sort of working model, and Leonardo da Vinci
as its typical figure, it would appear that the
method of resolution is all-round expression—expression
in as many forms and fields as the
creative powers direct. Leonardo was not only
an artist, he was a sculptor, a poet, an epigrammatist,
an engineer, a statesman, a soldier, a
musician, and I do not know what else besides.
He indulged his creative or expressive
impulses in every direction his “fancy”
indicated. Truly enough he was not equally
successful in an objective or critical sense
in all these fields; but quite as certainly he
owed his surpassing excellence in one or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of them to the fact that he tried them all.
The anti- or non-Renaissance type of mind
would doubtless conclude that if Leonardo, let
us say, had been content to be only a painter,
or only a sculptor, he would have succeeded
even more perfectly in that single mode of
expression into which <i>ex hypothesi</i> he might
have poured the energy otherwise squandered
in various subordinate channels. But concentrations
of energy of this kind are not always
successful; the energies, in fact, are not always
convertible; and the attempt to concentrate
may thus have the effect, not only of failing of
its direct object, but of engaging one part of
the total energy in suppressing another. At
any rate, the working hypothesis (and it did
work) of the Renaissance type is that a natural
multiplicity of modes of expression is better
than an unnatural or forced concentration. The
latter, if successful, may possibly lead to something
wonderful; but if unsuccessful, it ends
in hysteria, in unresolved conflicts. The former,
on the other hand, while it may lead to no
great excellence in any direction (though
equally it may be the condition of excellence)
is, at any rate, a resolution of the internal
conflict. We shall be well advised to deny
ourselves nothing in the region of æsthetic
creation. Let us “dabble” to our hearts’
content in every art-form to which our “fancy”
invites us. The results in a critical sense may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
unimportant; “art happens,” as Whistler used
to say, and it “happens,” it may be added,
in the course of play. The play is the thing,
and I have little doubt that the approaching
Renaissance will be heralded by a revival of
dilettantism in all the arts.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch56"><span class="smcap">“Shakespeare” Simplified.</span>—English
literary criticism lies under the disgrace of
accepting Shakespeare, the tenth-rate player,
as Shakespeare the divine author, and so long
as a mistake of this magnitude is admitted
into the canon, nobody of any perception can
treat the canon with respect. My theory of
authorship is simple, rational, and within the
support of common experience. All it requires
is that we should assume that Shakespeare the
theatre-manager had on his literary staff or
within call a wonderful dramatic genius whose
name we do not yet know; that this genius
was as modest as he was wonderful, and as
adaptable as he was original; and that, of the
plays passed to him for licking into shape
(plays drawn from Shakespeare the actor-manager’s
store), some he scarcely touched,
others he changed only here and there, while a
few, the few that appealed to his “fancy,”
he completely transformed and re-created in
his own likeness. There is nothing incredible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
nothing even requiring much subtlety to accept,
in this hypothesis. The Elizabethan age was
a strange age. It had very little of the passion
for self-advertisement that distinguishes our
own. It contained many anonymous geniuses
of whom the obscure translators of the Bible
were only one handful. The author of the
plays may well have been one of the number—a
quiet, modest, retiring sort of man, thankful
to be able to find congenial work in reshaping
plays to his own liking. That, at
any rate, is my surmise, and so far from thinking
the theory unimportant, I believe it throws
a beam of light on the psychology of genius
during the Elizabethan age.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch57"><span class="smcap">The “London Mercury” and English.</span>—It
goes without saying that the <i>London
Mercury</i> had what is called a “good Press.”
Without imputing it to Mr. Squire for unrighteousness,
it is a fact that Mr. Squire has
a “good Press” for whatever he chooses to
do. He appears to have been born with a
silver pen in his mouth, and for quite a number
of years now it has been impossible to take up
a literary journal without finding praise of Mr.
Squire in it. As a poet Mr. Squire deserves
<i>nearly</i> all that is said of him; not for the
mass of his work, but for an occasional poem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
of almost supreme excellence. As a literary
<i>causeur</i>, of whom <i>The Times</i> said in compliment
that “he never makes you think,” he has
the first and great qualification of readableness.
Finally, as a parodist he is without
a superior in contemporary literature. But
when one has said this, one has said all; for
Mr. Squire is not a great or even a sound
critic, he is not an impressive writer, and he
is not a distinguished or original thinker. Time
and Mr. Squire may prove my judgment wrong,
but I do not think, either, that he will make
a great or an inspiring editor. Great editorship
is a form of creation, and the great editor is
measured by the number and quality of the
writers he brings to birth—or to ripeness. We
shall see in course of time whether Mr. Squire
is a creator in this sense. So far, he has
not even a dark horse in his stable.</p>

<p>Among the objects set out to be accomplished
by the <i>London Mercury</i> is the advancement
of English style. It is a worthy and even
a momentous object, but the <i>London Mercury</i>
is not the first modern journal to venture upon
this quest. After all, I, in my way, during the
last seven years or so, have made occasional
references to current English style, and my
comments cannot be said to be distinguished
by any particular tenderness to bad English,
by whomsoever it has been written. It amused
me, therefore, to read sundry and divers exhortations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
to Mr. Squire to be severe, and, if need
be, “savage” in criticism, and especially when
I observed that some of the names appended
to the advice were of writers who have anything
but appreciated the severity, let alone the
“savagery,” of reviews addressed to themselves.
Let it pass. The thing in question
is English style, and nobody can be too enthusiastic
in its maintenance and improvement.
The peril of English style, I take it, lies in
its very virtue, that of directness, and its
fighting edges are to be found where the colloquial
and the vernacular (or, let us say, the
idiomatic) meet and mix. The English vernacular
is the most powerful and simple
language that was ever written, but the danger
always lies in wait for it of slipping into the
English colloquial, which, by the same token,
is one of the worst of languages. The difference
between them is precisely the difference
between Ariel and Caliban; and I am not sure
that “Shakespeare” had not this, among other
things, in mind when he dreamed his myth.
Caliban is a direct enough creature to be
English, and there are writers who imagine his
style to be the mirror of perfection. But Ariel
is no less direct; he is only Caliban transformed
and purified and become a thing of light. There
is, of course, no rule for distinguishing
between them; between the permissible and
the forbidden use of the colloquial; for it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
obvious that the vernacular is finally derived
from the colloquial. The decision rests with
taste, which alone can decide what of the colloquial
shall be allowed to enter into the
vernacular. In general, I should say, the
criterion is grace; the hardest, the rarest, but
the most exquisite of all the qualities of style.
I hope one day to see English written in the
vernacular, with all its strength and directness,
but with grace added unto it. Newman,
perhaps, was furthest of all writers on the way
to it. But Newman did not always charm.
Now I have written the word, I would substitute
charm for grace, and say that the
perfect English style, which nobody has yet
written, will charm by its power.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch58"><span class="smcap">Mr. G. K. Chesterton on Rome and
Germany.</span>—Hovelaque’s <i>Les Causes profondes
de la Guerre</i> is either the original or a
plagiarism of Mr. G. K. Chesterton’s theory
that the war was only an episode in the eternal
“revolt” of “Germany” against “Rome.”
I put these words into quarantine to signify
that they are to be handled with care; for it
is not only Germany or Rome that is in question,
but the psychological characteristics and
the relation between them which they embody.
Thus raised to psychological dimensions, Germany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and Rome become principles, types of
mentality: in radical opposition. Germany is
of one camp, Rome is of the other, and given
the fact of their inherent antagonism, war
between them is endless. Mr. Mann, a German
writer, has carried the subject further; he
has entered into particulars. In the following
pairs of qualities, tabulated by Mr. Mann, the
first of each is to be attributed to “Germany”
and the other to “Rome.” Heroic, rational;
people, masses; personality, individuality; culture,
civilisation; spiritual life, social life;
aristocracy, democracy; romance, classicism;
nationalism, internationalism. I do not know
how Mr. Chesterton will fare among these pairs
of opposites, for it appears to me that his
preferences are to be found at least as often
among the “German” group as among the
“Roman” group. There, however, they are,
as drawn up by a supporter of his general
theory, and we must leave him to make the
best of them.</p>

<p>There is another pair which Mr. Mann has
not mentioned, though it has been brought close
home to many of us. The German “Persius”
has confessed that “the lie has always been
one of Germany’s chief weapons, both by land
and sea.” The lie, however, is not the
“Roman” way; the “Roman” way is silence,
and anybody engaged in the dissemination of
ideas knows which of the two forms of opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
is the more difficult to meet. After all,
the liar takes risks; moreover, he does the
idea he opposes the honour of noticing it if
only to lie about it. But silence risks nothing;
it kills without leaving a trace.</p>

<p>Leaving the subject where, for the moment,
it is, we can inquire whether the suggested
antagonism is not altogether false. <i>Is</i> Rome
so eternal as all that, or Germany either? We
have been familiarised with a view that represents
the map of Europe as a map primarily
of mind; but I can discover in such a map
no confirmation of the statement that it is
Rome and Germany that are in permanent conflict.
On the contrary, what we call “formal
mind”—in other words, the rationalistic consciousness—appears
to me to distinguish
“Rome” quite as much as “Germany.” It
may be true that on the whole the “Roman”
qualities are better integrated and that the
“Roman” type is more completely a “man
of the world.” But, in comparison with a type
of the universal man, the man of the whole
world, I doubt whether it can be said that
the “Roman” is much more inclusive than the
German. Both exclude a good deal, and thus
the opposition between them is not of principle,
but of accident, the accident being that
the anthology of qualities which we call
“Rome” differs from the anthology called
German. It would follow from this that so far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
from being in necessarily eternal conflict
“Rome” and “Germany” are susceptible of
a synthesis in which the qualities of each will
complement the qualities of the other. “Germany,”
in other words, needs to Romanise,
while “Rome” needs to “Germanise.” Their
approach to each other would mark the end of
the conflict.</p>

<p>In so far as it is true that “Germany”
represents the “elemental instincts” always in
revolt against “Rome,” “the representative of
the supremacy of reason” (Hovelaque), there
are grounds for believing that a psychological
<i>rapprochement</i> is necessary to the psychic
health no less than to the peace of Europe.
Long before the war we heard, even in this
country, criticism of the right of reason to
supremacy; and, strangely enough, it was from
the “Roman” Mr. Chesterton that the criticism
came most powerfully. “Germany,” in that
case, may certainly be said to have taken the
lead in the active revolt against Rome; but
it was, we must observe, against a Rome
already weakened from within by the dissatisfaction
with Romanism of many of the leading
“Romans.” The fact is that the “supremacy
of reason,” for which “Rome” stands, is
always in danger, like every other supremacy,
of degenerating into a dictatorship; and the
dictatorship which reason was establishing
before the war involved precisely the suppression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
of the “elemental instincts” attributed
to Germany. The so-called encirclement of
Germany was, in fact, and in psychological
terms, the rational encirclement of instinct; and
I must again observe that it was not in geographical
Germany alone that the encirclement
was felt to be oppressive, but in every “Germany
within us,” in so far as each of us contained
“elemental instincts” of any kind. The
meaning of what I am saying is that the
elemental instincts, call them German, or anything
you please, cannot be permanently
tyrannised over by “reason”; nor should they
be. Nor is it necessary that reason should
attempt such a dictatorship. Its rule should
be that of a constitutional monarch under the
direction of representatives, not of itself, but
of the elemental instincts. The practical conclusion
to be drawn is that the “eternal
antagonism” of “Rome” and “Germany”
is not a necessary fact in psychology. It
becomes a fact only when “Rome” aims at
a dictatorship of reason to the inevitable isolation
and suppression of “Germany.” Reason
must learn how to cultivate its instincts.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that Mr. Chesterton
identifies “Rome” with the Holy See, though
others, no doubt, do. It is interesting, however,
to remark that before the war, and for
a considerable period during the war, the policy
of the Holy See was directed to the support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
of Germany. I have often wondered how a
Catholic like M. Hovelaque accommodates his
thesis with that fact. If the war, as he says,
was only an episode in the secular conflict of
Germany with Rome (meaning the Roman
Church as the spiritual successor of the Roman
Empire), how came it that before and during
the war the directors of the Roman Church
were pro-German? Something must surely be
wrong here; for either the Roman Church did
not take that view of Germany which
M. Hovelaque has defined, or, as seems to
me more probable, the Holy See had another
end in view than victory over Germany, namely,
alliance with a prospectively victorious Germany!
With this key, I think, the mystery is
unlocked for the ordinary man, however much
it continues sealed to the faithful. As <i>The
Times Literary Supplement</i> said: “Modernists
understand no better than Newman the springs
of Roman ecclesiastical policy, which is never
fanatical or idealistic, but always based on cool
political calculation.” And, undoubtedly, the
“cool political calculation” of the Holy See,
both before and during the first years of the
war, was that Germany would win. If this was
not the case, how are we to explain the sudden
change over of policy when it began to appear
that Germany, after all, was not to be the
victor? That at a certain stage in the war
such a change took place is well known to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
everybody, and it was openly admitted in the
Catholic <i>Dublin Review</i>. “The pendulum of
Catholicism,” said the <i>Dublin Review</i>, “has
swung away from Germany ... with Austria
and Spain ... and with the English-speaking
peoples and their Latin Allies the Catholic
order in the era of the future.” The “eternal
conflict” theory must go by the board after
this, for it obviously fails to fit the facts.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch59"><span class="smcap">The Origins of Marx.</span>—It is to be hoped
that the reputation of Marx will not long survive
the war unimpaired. I can scarcely think
that the German Socialists will be so proud
of their Marxism in the future as they have
been in the past, since it will have clearly
betrayed them into one of the most shameful
moral surrenders in all history. It is dangerous
for a man’s writings to be regarded as the
“Bible” even of Socialists; and when, in
addition, the Marxian Bible, unlike the other,
aims at and, in a sense, achieves, logical consistency,
the peril of it is greater upon minds
lacking the inestimable virtue of common sense.
Marx was not himself a slave of his own inspiration;
he was anything but a Marxian in
the sense in which his followers are Marxian.
He had, indeed, a very sharp word for certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
of the disciples whose breed, unfortunately, has
not been extinguished by it. “Amateur
anarchists,” he called them, who “make up
by rabid declarations and bloodthirsty rampings
for the utter insignificance of their
political existence.” Groups of his disciples,
answering perfectly to this description, are to
be found to-day in English as well as in other
Labour circles. In between their rampings
they reveal their political insignificance by inquiring
of each other such elementary facts
about literature and history as schoolboys
should be ashamed to have forgotten. And
the surprising thing is that even these open
confessions induce no reaction upon their
conviction that they understand Marx.</p>

<p>It is a common supposition among Marx’s
followers that not only has he left nothing to
be said on the subject of economics, but that
nothing was said before him. One German
Socialist, at any rate, has rid himself of this
notion, for Dr. Menger has remarked that
“Marx was completely under the influence of
the earlier English Socialists, and more particularly
of William Thompson.” In a valuable
essay upon Marx, by Professor Alfred Rahilly,
the facts are let out. Marx, it appears, came
across Thompson’s work on <i>The Distribution of
Wealth</i> (1824) in the British Museum, and
read it with great profit. From Thompson he
took practically all his chief doctrines, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the exception of his peculiar interpretation of
history in terms of economics. The theory
of Value as measured by labour-power, the
distinction between capital and capitalism, the
law of decreasing utility, and, above all, the
very phrase as well as the very idea of Surplus
Value—all of these “Marxian” doctrines Marx
found in Thompson. I am not arguing that
Marx was the less for having been indebted
to his English predecessors. He would, indeed,
in my opinion, have been a greater man
if he had borrowed more of Thompson, for
Thompson possessed the common sense to
realise that it was possible that the concentration
of capital might take place simultaneously,
with a diffusion of ownership—an idea which
would have spared Marx the ignominy of many
of his most fanatical disciples. What, on the
other hand, was great in Marx, was his capacity
for large generalisations, and his industry in
establishing them. In this respect he belonged
to the great Victorians, and, as such, he
deserves more credit than his present-day
followers will permit him to receive.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch60"><span class="smcap">Marx as Politician.</span>—The centenary celebrations
of Marx ought not to conclude
without a tribute to his astonishing political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
insight. Philosophically Marx was confused;
as an economist he has suffered from his
disciples; but as a political critic he has
seldom been surpassed. Particular attention may
be drawn to his analysis of the circumstances of
Bismarck’s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, and
to his forecast of the consequences. Though
writing in London, and without our historic
knowledge of the Ems telegram, or our present
knowledge of the world-war, Marx might have
written his manifesto to-day; but, in that case,
I doubt whether he would be published in
Germany, or read with much attention by
Marx’s followers in this country. It is a
strange reflection, indeed, upon the fate of the
works of Marx that it is precisely the most
clear and prophetic part of them which his
professed followers neglect. For his dubious
forecasts and his riddling analyses they have
a reverence that transcends bibliolatry; but,
concerning his most absolute and explicit
political policies—not a word!</p>

<p>The war of 1870, as we all know, was
for Germany a declared war of defence, exactly
like the present war. Germany is always defending
herself at the world’s expense. No
sooner, however, had the ostensible motive of
defence been satisfied by Sedan, than the real
objects of German militarism began to be revealed.
Unhindered by the earlier protestations
of the Emperor William that Germany was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
at war only with Napoleon and not with
France, the militarists inspired the German
liberal bourgeoisie to press for annexations in
the name of race and security. They dared to
pretend, said Marx, that the people of the two
provinces were burning to be annexed to
Germany, and they adopted without reflection
the excuse of the military party that a rectification
of the Imperial frontiers was a strategic
necessity. Thus, concluded Marx, they insisted
upon sowing in the terms of peace the seeds
of new wars—the phrase is Marx’s own. And
what wars, too! Marx was not blind to their
probable character. History, he said, would
not measure the German offence by the number
of miles of territory annexed, but by the significance
of the fact of annexation. This
significance was no less than a declaration of
“a policy of conquest,” from which might be
anticipated in logical order a German racial
war against “the Slav and Latin races combined.”
The war of 1870, having thus ended,
would, he said, be the precursor of a series
of international wars, in the course of which it
was probable that the working-classes everywhere
would succumb to the forces of
militarism and capitalism. What comment has
the <i>Call</i> or any of our contemporary Marxian
pacifists to make upon this? It is not right
that they should ignore it, more especially when
it is recalled that Marx paid a tribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
English working-classes of his day, who “protested
with all their might against the
dismemberment of France.”</p>

<p class="section" id="ch61"><span class="smcap">John Mitchel as the Same.</span>—Marx,
however, was not the only observer of the
events of 1870 to be moved to prophecy by
them. As a matter of fact, everything has
been foreseen. John Mitchel, the Irish
Nationalist, whose name is invoked by Sinn
Feiners to-day, was in Paris before the 1870
war, and wrote of the events of the war in
the <i>Irish Citizen</i> and elsewhere during its progress.
He, too, had no illusions concerning the
nature of Prussian militarism, and though his
sympathies were mainly with France, he had
a word of warning for England. “Prussia,”
he said, “cannot be England’s friend. Prussia
has her own aspirations and ambitions; one of
these is to be a great maritime power, or
rather <i>the</i> great maritime Power of Europe;
and nothing in the future can be more sure
than that Prussia, if successful in this struggle
with France, will take Belgium, and threaten
from Antwerp the mouth of the Thames.”
Things have not worked out exactly as Mitchel
prophesied, but they have worked out nearly
enough to justify his political clairvoyance.
Like Marx, he was not deceived by the events<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
before him, and both saw in them the shadows
of the events which have now befallen us. I
remark with irony that just as the self-styled
followers of the economist Marx ignore the
political judgments of their master, the professed
inheritors of the Nationalist opinions of
Mitchel ignore his international opinions. It
is in this way that the garments of the great
are divided, and the seamless coat shredded
to make partisan ribbons.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch62"><span class="smcap">Norse in English.</span>—Professor C. H.
Herford makes a meritorious attempt to recall
attention to the influence and value of the
Norse Myths upon English Poetry. William
Morris was most powerfully and directly influenced
by the Sagas, and of Morris Professor
Herford says that “no other English poet has
felt so keenly the power of Norse myth; none
has done so much to restore its terrible beauty,
its heroism, its earth-shaking humour, and its
heights of tragic passion and pathos, to a
place in our memories, and a home in our
hearts.” It will not do, however, for (let me
whisper it) who reads Morris’s poetry to-day?
Has he a home in our hearts? Are his Norse
enthusiasms really anything to us? I am not
defending our generation for neglecting Morris,
or for being indifferent to the Norse theogony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of which he was a prophet. Our age is one
of prose, and the passion of prose is justice—reasonable
and regulated justice. Terrible
beauty, earth-shaking humour, tragic passion,
and so on—the stuff of epic poetry—are relegated
nowadays to the police court. Moreover,
the Norse mythology is not only
“pagan” in the sense of being non-Christian,
it is pagan in the sense of being sub- as much
as pre-Christian, differing in this respect from
the Indian mythology of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, or
the Egyptian mythology of the <i>Book of the
Dead</i>. We can never return to it without committing
an act of regression, since it is a
paganism of a world inferior rather than
superior to the “Christian” world. At the
same time, since we must carry all our sheaves
with us in order to enjoy the complete harvest
of the human soul, it is necessary not to drop
from consciousness the heroic past, albeit a
past to which we may not return. Let it be
enshrined and enjoyed in poetry and music
now that it is no longer possible in life.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch63"><span class="smcap">The Comedy of It.</span>—Comedy still remains
a secret hid from the English mind, and not
all the efforts of Mr. John Francis Hope to
bring it into popularity will succeed where the
prior efforts of Meredith have failed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
reason, as Mr. Hope has often explained it,
even more clearly than Meredith, is not only
that the spirit of Comedy demands “a society
of cultivated men and women, wherein ideas
are current and perceptions quick”—a condition
certainly not now existing—but the
absence of three qualities, each of which, unfortunately,
blooms luxuriantly among us—“sentimentalism,
puritanism, and bacchanalianism.”
Comedy, the play of the mind about
real ideas, is quite incompatible with any one
of these three vices. If you sentimentalise,
play is over, and equally it is over if you are
shocked, or if you carry the <i>suggested</i> humour
of the situation too far. But one of these
things the ordinary English man or woman is
almost bound to do; and thus it comes about
that “play,” the sparkle of common sense, is
so rare among us.</p>

<p>Meredith certainly worked very hard to instil
Comedy into the English mind. His essay
is a classic, and our only classic on the subject.
And he may be said to have written the whole
of his novels in order to illustrate his idea.
Meredith’s novels are much more than a mirror
held up in Nature; they are a model held up to
human nature; and, from this point of view,
they are only an appendix to the <i>Essay on
Comedy</i>. The serious way in which Meredith’s
novels are read, however, is an evidence of
his failure, and it would be interesting to hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
his secret comment on the critics who acclaim
him as the grand portrait-painter of women.
Did Meredith even set himself to draw a
woman? Was his art not rather to “draw
out” a woman from the imperfect society his
times provided him? Were not his “portraits,”
in fact, constructive criticisms of the women he
knew? I put these opinions into interrogation
out of mere courtesy, for there is really no
doubt whatever about them. Meredith drew
women still to be, as he hoped they would
become.</p>

<p>“To love comedy you must know the real
world, and know men and women well enough
not to expect too much of them, though you
may still hope for good.” That is an almost
complete summary of the conditions of the
comic spirit; but there must be added the
“sense of society,” the social sense, which
is quite as important. This also introduces
a considerable difficulty for us, since if “our
English school had not clearly imagined
society” in 1877, when Meredith wrote, it
is less than ever probable to-day. In 1877,
such people of intelligence as were living in
England were still more or less homogeneous
in their general views about life. They were
not eighteenth century—the century of our
highest English social culture; but they were
not yet what we have subsequently become,
discrete and warring atoms of intellectuality.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
It was possible when Meredith was alive for
a group of people to meet, and to create something
remotely resembling a salon. The hope
of realising a “salon spirit” was not entirely
dead. To-day nothing is more improbable
than even an attempt to restore a salon. Not
only would nobody undertake to do it, but
to nobody would it occur that its restoration is
highly desirable. But the salon is, as it were,
the foyer of the theatre of Comedy, as the
theatre of Comedy is itself the foyer of the
Civilised Life of Brilliant Common Sense; and
if we cannot re-create a salon it is perfectly
certain that the greater mysteries are beyond
us. We may continue, however, to “hope
for good,” since that also is an essential of
Comedy.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch64"><span class="smcap">The Epic Serbs.</span>—<i>Kossovo: the Heroic
Songs of the Serbs</i>, translated by Miss Helen
Rootham, has now been published for some
months. If there is any “epic sense” alive
in this country, it must surely be gratified
by the appearance of these Serbian ballads,
which are much more truly epic fragments than
ballads as we understand the term. In the
ballad proper the prevailing note is tragedy—sometimes
individual, sometimes family,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
sometimes clan; but in the Serbian, as in the
Homeric, the tragedy expressed in the popular
poetry is more spacious even than the nation;
the nation becomes the race, and the race
symbolises a psychological power, which may
very well be called a god—a suffering god.
Grimm said of these ballads that there had
been “nothing since Homer to compare with
them; they were the best of all times and
nations.” Goethe compared them to the <i>Song
of Songs</i>. Certainly there is something
Homeric in them; and since they are sung
to-day, they can be regarded as unique. Long
dwelling on them, with a view to discovering
their innermost secret, convinces me, however,
that they differ from the Homeric mood in
their comparative hopelessness. Mr. Baring says
in his Introduction that these Serbian ballad-writers
“saw the world with the eyes of a
child and the heart of a man.” “Child” is
a word of multiple <i>entente</i>; and the difference
between the Homeric and the Serbian
“childhood” is that the latter appears doubtful
whether it can grow up. Homer, we know,
occasionally let fall a sad regret that his
splendid heroes should still be children; and
in the plays of Æschylus the high philosophical
meditations of Homer are considerably
elaborated. But in these Serbian ballads there
does not appear to me any sign of the <i>mind</i>
of a man, however much of the heart there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
may be. No Serbian Plato will ever find in
them such a text as the Greek Plato found
in Homer. It is not to be wondered at. Serbia
has always been on the frontier of European
civilisation, and perpetually in the trenches.
Since 1389 Serbia has been in unbroken but
unsubmissive captivity, and her deliverance
from alien bondage is only an event of yesterday.
But if the elements of the future are
contained in the quintessence of these ballads,
there is no sight of a new Athens in them.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch65"><span class="smcap">Ernest Dowson.</span>—Mr. Arthur Symons’s
Introduction to the reprinted <i>Poems and Prose</i>
of the late Ernest Dowson has all the
characteristics of the age to which both he
and Dowson belonged. It is delicately appreciative,
and not lacking in good judgment. Mr.
Symons says, for instance, that Dowson was
small enough to be overwhelmed by experiences
that would have been nourishing
food to a great man. But the style and
manner of passing judgment almost completely
contradict the matter of the judgment itself,
and leave us in doubt whether Mr. Symons
is not judging against his judgment. Literary
criticism does not need to be literature; least
of all does it need to be belles-lettres. Yet Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Arthur Symons and his whole school seem to
aim at precisely this effect, that of writing in
the same style as the work criticised. Thus
we find him saying of Dowson: “all the
fever and turmoil and the unattained dreams
of a life which had so much of the swift,
disastrous, and suicidal impetus of genius”—words
and phrases which might have been
written by Dowson himself. They are apologiastic
of the person when what we ask of
criticism is judgment of the quality of the
style, and in the unfortunate identification of
genius with disaster and suicide they are almost
an incentive to the little artists to trade on their
neuroses. I do not know whether Mr. Symons
knew Dowson personally; it is of no importance;
but his bedside manner with ailing
geniuses would have been anything but tonic.</p>

<p>It is symptomatic of Dowson’s state of mind,
though Mr. Symons misses the subtlety of it,
that he was always repeating Poe’s line: “the
viol, the violet, and the vine.” A special
affection for labials and liquids is conclusive
evidence of minority, not to say infantilism;
and stylists with any ambition to excel, and to
develop both themselves and their style, will
be wise to watch their “v’s” and “m’s” and
“l’s,” in fact, their labials and liquids
generally. Dowson wallowed in liquids and
labials to the end of his short life; his
vocabulary never grew up, and I have no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
that, had he been asked to quote his own best
lines, he would have pointed, not to the
notorious “Cynara,” which is sufficiently pretty-pretty,
but to these lines, in which he came as
near to Poe as originality permits:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Violets and leaves of vine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Love that lives a day.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“One is essentially of the autumn,” he wrote
of himself. But that is not true, for Dowson
was not ripe, but (I say it of course with
respect) rotten. He remained in the cradle
sucking sensations long after he should have
been out in the world creating sensations. Life
never got beyond his lips.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch66"><span class="smcap">A Sentimental Excursion.</span>—The writers
of the <i>Venture</i>, a literary magazine published
from Bristol, and written chiefly by members
of the Postal Service, are sincere in that they
are manifestly striving to acquire a good
English style; and they are modest in that
they do not pretend to have attained to it.
Even better, and unlike so many current
“stylists,” they do not say that the unreachable
grapes are sour, while those only which they
can pluck are the perfect fruit; in other words,
they do not try to pass off their defects as new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
beauties of style. Their models are good, and
their exercises are promising. The introductory
note contains, however, a little cant,
rather out of key with the prevailing mood of
the journal. It demands “stalwart criticism,”
not for itself only, but for literature in general.
The <i>London Mercury</i> appeared before the world
in the same austere attitude, calling in
prophetic tones for sterner criticism, more outspoken
criticism, criticism that should both say
and mean something, criticism, in short, of the
kind which has for years ensured the ostracism
of precisely that kind of critic. It is the easiest
thing in the world to demand such criticism,
and very popular on one condition—that it be
never actually provided. For the fact is that
the criticism in question is really killing; and
how many of those who ask for stern criticism
would welcome their own extinction?</p>

<p>Special attention is directed to the longish
poem by Mr. Francis Andrews. It is entitled
“Mother,” and the opening stanza is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You can see from the gate which once enclosed my world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tinted woods o’ the hill and the white road wending,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And among the nearer boughs whereon my stars were hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blown and shifting wraith of the blue smoke curled.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let us stop at that and collect our impressions.
It is a very dangerous subject that Mr. Andrews<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
has chosen. The temptation to indulge in
“sob-stuff” in reflecting on “Mother,” is well-nigh
irresistible, since the sentiment goes back
to the childhood not only of the individual, but
of the race, and probably earlier. It is almost
inextricably mingled with the tears of things.
But tears are not a proper accompaniment of
poetry or of beauty. The mission of Art is
to dry all tears, and the utmost severity and
serenity are needed in dealing with a profoundly
emotional subject exactly to keep the
tears from welling into it. That Mr. Andrews
has not succeeded is evident from the opening
stanza which I have just quoted. It is almost
drenched with sentiment. Listen to the rhythm
which is nearly a lullaby in reverie, and let us
ask ourselves whether it is not calculated, quite
apart from the words, to throw the reader backwards
into his mother’s arms. “Which once
enclosed my world,” “and the white road
wending,” “whereon my stars were hung,”
“the blown and shifting wraith of blue smoke
curled”—these are sentimental rhythms, and
their inevitable effect is to induce a reverie of
the past rather than a meditation or contemplation
of the future. The mood is backward-looking,
and not forward-looking, an indulgence
and not an effort of spirit. It is quite in
accordance with the diagnosis that a concluding
stanza of the poem should repeat the opening
stanza, since there is no release in a mood of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
this kind. In great reveries it will be observed
that the movement is forward and upwards.
The action starts from a profound sentiment,
but it works its way upward to a triumphant
assertion of spiritual realisation. Look, for instance,
at <i>Lycidas</i> or <i>Adonais</i>, both sentimental
in origin, but both exalted in conclusion.
There the song springs from a dewy bed,
drenched with tears, but it mounts and mounts
until it ends in the sky. Mr. Andrews keeps
well to the ground, and, as I have said, his
concluding stanza is only a slight variation
of the prelude. The influence of Kipling is
to be discerned at work, especially Kipling’s
“Envoi,” beginning, “There’s a whisper down
the field.” Kipling is another of the writers
whose sentiment is still tied to his mother’s
apron-strings; and his “Envoi” and “Mother
o’ Mine” are almost as poisonous to poetry as
Meredith’s “Love in the Valley.” We need not
be averse to sentiment as such, but the most
careful discrimination between the nest and the
sky is essential to an æsthetic use of it. Let us
start in sentiment, by all means, but let us rise
from it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch67"><span class="smcap">The Newest Testament.</span>—Various
attempts have been made from time to time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
“render” the New Testament into colloquial
English in order to bring it “up-to-date.”
None of these, we may congratulate ourselves,
has so far been more than a nine days’ sensation,
and even less than that length of life is
destined for the latest attempt, <i>Sayings and
Stories</i>, a translation into “colloquial English”
of the Sermon on the Mount and some
Parables. The Yates Professor of New Testament
Greek and Exegesis at Mansfield College
gives us his assurance that however “startlingly
unlike the familiar versions” these
translations by Mr. Hoare may be, they are
nevertheless “actual translations and not mere
paraphrases,” and he commends the “style”
to the “candid judgment of the reader.” The
prose sections, in particular, he says, are
“curiously reminiscent” of the “homely
speech in which the sayings of Jesus Christ
have been preserved.” It may be so, but then,
again, it may not; since, after all, it is not
a question of reproducing in colloquial English
the colloquial Greek of the original, but a
question rather of reproducing in English the
meaning of the Gospel writers; and this may
very well require, not colloquial English, but
the English vernacular in its highest degree
of purity, simplicity, and grandeur. I am not
sufficiently acquainted with the popular Greek
in which much of the New Testament was
written to pass a candid judgment on its quality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
as a Greek style, but if the aim of the original
writers was the grand style simple—as it must
have been—whether they achieved it or not, it
is indubitably achieved in the English of the
authorised translation. Assuming the original,
in fact, to be “faithfully” represented in the
colloquial English of Mr. Hoare, I unhesitatingly
say that the English of the authorised
translation is nearer the spirit of the original
than the present translation, and, in that sense,
more fully faithful to the intentions of the
original authors.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to cite more than one
example, and I will take it in the very first
sentence of Mr. Hoare’s translation. “What
joy,” he says, “for those with the poor man’s
feelings! Heaven’s Empire is for them,” the
authorised translation of which is too familiar
to need quotation. I do not see what is gained,
setting aside the cost, by the substitution of the
exclamatory “What joy ...” for the ecstatic
affirmation, “Blessed are the poor.” Why
again, “the poor man,” and, after that, the
“poor man’s feelings”? Why also “Heaven’s
Empire” instead of “the Kingdom of
Heaven”; and why “is for them” instead
of “theirs is”? The gain, even literally, is
imperceptible, and in cost a world of meaning
has been sacrificed. “Blessed” is an incomparably
more spiritual word than “joy”—in
English, at any rate, whatever their respective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
originals may indicate; and there is a plane
of difference between an incontinent ejaculation
such as “What joy,” which resembles
“What fun,” and has in view rather a prospect
than a fact—and the serene and confident
utterance of an assured truth. Further, and
again without regard to the literal original,
“a poor man’s feelings” must be miles away,
from the intention of the original authors, since
it definitely conveys to us associations derived
from social surroundings, social reform, and
what not. Was <i>this</i> the intention of the
Sermon on the Mount, the very location of
which symbolised a state of mind above that
of the dwellers in the plain of common life?
Was it a socialist or communist discourse? If
not, the “poor man’s feelings,” in our English
colloquial sense, is utterly out of place, and
the original must have meant something
symbolically different. The substitution, again,
of “Heaven’s Empire” for the “Kingdom of
Heaven” may be, as Professor Dodd assures
us, a more correct literal translation of the
original phrase; but only a literary barbarian
can contemplate it without grieving over the
lost worlds of meaning. What is the prospect
of an “Empire,” even Heaven’s Empire, to
us to-day? As certainly as the phrase “Kingdom
of Heaven” has come to mean, in English,
a state of beatitude, the reversion to an
“Empire” marks the decline of that state to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
one of outward pomp and circumstance. The
spiritual meaning which must have characterised
the intention of the Sermon on the Mount is
completely sacrificed in the substitution of
Empire for Kingdom. The volume is published
by the “Congregational Union of England and
Wales,” and it serves to indicate the depths to
which Nonconformist taste can sink. We only
need now this “colloquial English” version
in the “nu speling” to touch bottom.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch68"><span class="smcap">Nothing Foreign.</span>—It is better for a nation
to “import” art than to go without it altogether;
and it is the <i>duty</i> of its critics to
stimulate home-production by importing as
many as possible of the best foreign models.
That home-production may fail to find itself
encouraged to the point of creation is perfectly
possible; inspiration may continue to be
wanting; but of the two states of no home-production
and no imports and no home-production
and imports, the latter is to be
preferred.</p>

<p>“Foreign” is a word that should be employed
with increasing discrimination, and, most
of all, by English writers. There is an English
genius the perfect flower of which we have
still to see; for perfect English has never yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
been written. But nothing foreign ought to
be alien to a race as universal in character
and mentality as the English; and in the
end, the perfection of the English genius is
only possible in a spiritual synthesis of all the
cultures of the world. Two tendencies equal
and opposite are at work in this direction,
and have always been in English history. On
the one side, we find an ever-present tendency
towards cosmopolitanism, an excess of
which would certainly result in the complete
loss of essential national characteristics. On
the other side, and usually balancing the first,
we find an ever-present tendency towards insularity
and æsthetic chauvinism, the excess of
which would undoubtedly result in a caricature
of the English genius—the development of
idiosyncrasies in place of style. Somewhere
between these two tendencies the critic of
English art must fix his seat, in order that his
judgment may determine, as far as possible,
the perfect resultant of the blend of opposites.
It is a matter, too, of time as well as of forms
of culture. Not only are not all times alike,
but there is a time for import and a time for
export and a time for “protection”; but,
equally, there is room for discrimination in the
kind of art that may wisely be imported or
exported. In general, we should import only
what we need and export only what other
nations need, and thus, in the old mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
sense, traffic in treasure. Thus guarded,
nothing but good can come of the greatest
possible international commerce of the arts.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch69"><span class="smcap">Psycho-Analysis.</span>—Psycho-analysis is not
the last word in psychological method; and
a great deal more of experiment is needed.
Freud’s theory of dreams, for instance, is excellent
pioneer work in a field hitherto left more
or less uncultivated, but it is very far from
being exhaustively explanatory of the facts.
Suppose it were possible to <i>control</i> dreams—in
other words, to dream of what you will—would
not the theory of Freud that dreams are
subconscious wish-fulfilments stand in need of
amendment? But to control dreams is not an
utter impossibility. Sufficient experimental
work has been done in this direction to prove
that the gate of dreams is open to the intelligent
will. And there is warrant for the attempt
in a good deal of mystical literature. I was
reading only recently the poems of Vaughan the
Silurist, and what should I come across but the
following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Being laid and dress’d for sleep, close not thy eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up with the curtains; give thy soul the wing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In some good thoughts; so when the day shall rise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou unrak’st thy fire, those sparks will bring</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">New flames; besides, where these lodge, vain heats mourn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And die; that bush where God is shall not burn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Vaughan’s lines are not great poetry, but they
contain a useful psychological hint.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch70"><span class="smcap">Psycho-Analysis and the Mysteries.</span>—It
would be unwise to make a dogma of any of
the present conclusions of psycho-analysis. As
a means of examining the contents of the subconscious,
psycho-analysis is an instrument of
the highest value, but in the interpretation of
what it finds there, and in the conclusions it
draws as to their origin—how the apple got
into the dumpling, in fact—psycho-analysis
requires to be checked by all the knowledge we
have at our command. Mr. Mead has raised
the question of origins, but it is just as easy
to raise the question of interpretation. I am
not satisfied that the interpretation placed by
Jung on myths is any more than correct as far
as it goes, and I am disposed to think that it
does not go far enough. His reduction, for
example, of a whole group of myths to the
“incest” motive, appears to me, even in the
light of his definition of incest as the “backward
urge into childhood,” to give us only a
partial truth, an aspect of truth. For there is
a sense in which an “urge into childhood”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
is not backward but forward, not a regression
into an old, but a progression into a new
childhood. “Unless ye become as little
children, ye can in no wise enter the Kingdom
of Heaven.” “Incest” is a strictly improper
term to apply to such a transformation; the
new birth might suit the case better. Mr. Mead
takes the same view. The interpretations of
psycho-analysis carry us back, he suggests, to
the lesser mysteries; but they need to be
“elevated” in the Thomist sense in order to
carry us back to the greater. So long as it
confines itself to the “body” psycho-analysis
must plainly be confined to the lesser mysteries,
for the lesser mysteries are all concerned with
generation. The greater mysteries are concerned
with regeneration, and, hence, with the
“soul”; and even if we assume the “soul”
to require a body, we are outside the region
of ordinary generation if that body is not the
physical body. The psycho-analytic interpretation
suffers from this confinement of its text
to the physical body, since “the genuine myth
has first and foremost to do with the life of
the soul.”</p>

<p>Another caution to remember is that reality
cannot be grasped with one faculty or with
several; it requires them all. Only the whole
can grasp the whole. For this reason it is
impossible to “think” reality; for though the
object of thought may be reality, all reality is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
not to be thought. Similarly, it is impossible
to “feel” or to “will” or to “sense” reality
completely. Each of these modes of experiencing
reality reports us only a mode of reality,
and not the whole of it. Before we can say
certainly that a thing is true—before, that is,
we can affirm a reality—it must not only think
true, but feel true, sense true, and do true.
The pragmatic criterion that reports a thing
to be true because it works may be contradicted
by the intellectual criterion that reports a thing
to be true because it “thinks” true; and when
these both agree in their report, their common
conclusion may fail to be confirmed by the
criterion of feeling that reports a thing to be
true when it “feels” true. It is from an
appreciation of the many-sided nature of truth,
and, consequently, from an appreciation of the
many faculties required to grasp it, that the
value set by the world on common sense is
derived. For common sense is the community
of the senses or faculties; in its outcome it is
the agreement of their reports. A thing is said
to be common sense when it satisfies the heart,
the mind, the emotion, and the senses; when,
in fact, it satisfies all our various criteria of
reality. Otherwise a statement may be logical,
it may be pleasing, it may be practical, it
may be obvious; but only when it is all is it
really common sense.</p>

<p>But can we, with only our present faculties,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
however developed and harmonised, ever arrive
at reality? It may be that in the natural order
of things, humanity implies by definition a
certain state of ignorance, and that this state
is only to be transcended by the overpassing
of the “human” condition. Psycho-analysis
is still only at the beginning of its discoveries,
but on the very threshold we are met by the
problem of the nascent or germinal faculties
of the mind. Are there in the subconscious,
“yearning to mix themselves with life,”
faculties for which “humanity” has not yet
developed end-organs? If this be so, as our
fathers have told us, the next step in evolution
is to develop them.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch71"><span class="smcap">Gently with Psycho-Analysis.</span>—I
am doubtful whether we have sufficiently
developed the ideas of psycho-analysis to make
a fruitful parallel possible between them and
the ideas contained in Patanjali. Psycho-analysis,
as the name indicates, is more concerned
with analysis than with synthesis, and
“Yoga,” whose dominant idea is re-union or
synthesis, appears to be rather a complement
than an analogue of psycho-analysis in the
broad sense. Take, for example, the idea of
Yoga as a means to the re-union of the individual
with the world-soul: “Thou art That;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Thou shalt become That.” According to Jung,
this attempt at re-union may be nothing more
than a megalomaniac regressive introversion,
representing on a grand scale a return to the
mother and infantilism. Since it is separation
from the mother (actual and metaphorical),
that, in Jung’s view, creates the basis of consciousness,
any attempt to become re-united
with the “mother” is an act of regression.
It is obvious from this dissonance of doctrine
that Yoga and psycho-analysis have not as yet
discovered any profound common ground; in
fact, in some respects they appear to be opposed.</p>

<p>I count myself among the increasing number
of enthusiastic students of psycho-analysis. It
is the hopeful science of the dawning era. No
new era appears to me to be possible without
it, and such a work as Dr. Ernest Jones’s
<i>Psycho-Analysis</i> is one of the books most worth
buying at the present time. But it is elsewhere
that I find the best justification for my enthusiasm,
in these words from an old Hermetic
text: “The beginning of perfection is gnosis
of man; but gnosis of God is perfected perfection.”
Psycho-analysis thus appears to be
the beginning of the gnosis of man, and, in
this sense, the beginning of perfection. But
it is only the beginning. Mere morality, however
psychological, is no substitute for religion;
and the most profoundly and sincerely moral
of men—Ibsen, for example—end in a state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
of despair unless at the point at which their
morality gives out, religion of some kind comes
to their aid. Psycho-analysis, I think it will
be found, is doomed, while it remains analysis,
to end in the same state of despair. It will
teach us all there is to be known about the
nature of man; but the gnosis of man is not
satisfying. For it is only thereafter and when
man is transcended as an object of gnosis that
perfected perfection is possible. I would not,
however, hasten by a single impatient step this
second and completing phase of the process
of our learning. The gnosis of man is necessary
to the gnosis of God, and God can well
look after Himself and bide our time. Furthermore,
a premature attempt to know God before
we are initiated into the mysteries of the gnosis
of man must be heavily paid for. Religion
without humanity is more dangerous than
humanity without religion. Let us then settle
down with concentrated attention to the problem
before us, the material and method of which
are to be found in psycho-analysis. We shall
be able to afford to whistle when we are
through that wood.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch72"><span class="smcap">A Cambridge “Cocoon.”</span>—The new Cambridge
magazine, <i>The Cocoon</i>, cannot be
regarded as superfluous, the editors suggest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
since its point of view is unique. It is not
written by “theological” minds that “estimate
affairs in relation to unchangeable dogmas
and fixed beliefs,” but by minds that hold that
things “are capable of more than one truthful
interpretation.” The second of these contentions
is true enough, but, unfortunately, the
new interpretations of <i>The Cocoon</i>, however
truthful, are trivial. Age, we are told, sees
the Moon as just a “heavenly body”; whereas
the youth who spin <i>The Cocoon</i> see the Moon
as “a wonderful cheese” or a prehistoric coin.
Age, again, looks at the Great Pyramid and
interprets it as a pyramidal structure; but
our spinning youth interpret it as a “colossal
and awe-inspiring cube,” with emphasis on the
awe. The difference between the interpretations
is, to my mind, all in favour of age. It may
be true that the Moon is translatable in terms
of cheese, and the Great Pyramid may really
be a cube, but the interpretations are without
interest or value. If <i>The Cocoon</i> had said
that the Moon might conceivably be the Devil,
or the Great Pyramids the psychic meeting-place
of the Rosicrucians, the new “interpretation”
might have had some interest. As
it is, we are back in the nursery, and not by
any means in the nursery of the race. The
earlier editorial affirmation is not even sense,
but a contradiction of sense. “To estimate
affairs in relation to unchangeable dogmas and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
fixed beliefs,” is not theological only, it is
only means of estimating at all. Things <i>are</i>
so and so, and the unchangeability of dogma
and fixity of belief are determined, or should
be, by the corresponding unchangeability and
fixity of things as they are. When we find
that the nature of things changes arbitrarily
from day to day, we may consider the advisability
of changing our belief that it is fixed
as rapidly as nature itself is transformed.
Otherwise, if anything we say is to be
“true,” it must be because there is a fixed
and unchangeable nature to which our dogmas
and beliefs refer. The alternative is not youth
and imagination and “other truthful interpretations
of things,” it is nursery chatter about
cheese and pyramidal cubes.</p>

<p>Pass the articles on Balzac and D’Annunzio,
both of which might have been written by
Old Age or even by Middle Age, and let us
see how the state of mind calling itself Youth
deals with history. Remember that Cambridge,
where the Cocoons come from, regards itself as
“the nursery of the nation”; and then listen
to Mr. L. J. Cheney, no doubt one of our
future representatives on the World-League,
preparing his programme. “It is stupid,” he
says, “to write history or to study history,
on the assumption that we Western Europeans
are the salt of the earth.” And Mr. H. Y.
Oulsham, on the same subject, remarks that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
“we must keep the sociological aim of history
in sight”; ... “the be-all and end-all of
history is sociology.” No wonder the <i>Manchester
Guardian</i>—the guardian, that is to say,
of Manchester—found <i>The Cocoon</i> so promising,
for the opinions expressed by Mr. Cheney
and Mr. Oulsham are embryos of <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> “leaders,” they are <i>so</i> cosmopolitan
and <i>so</i> humanitarian. Apart, however, from
their extreme Age, bordering on decrepitude,
I find in them not even an unimportant
“truthful interpretation.” It is not true that
sociology is the be-all and end-all of history
as it ought to be written; and to deny, in the
name of history, that Western Europe <i>is</i> the
salt of the earth (however it may have lost its
savour) is just to deny and repudiate European
world-responsibility. Things, again, <i>are</i> so and
so, and not otherwise, let Youth interpret them
as it will. Europe <i>is</i> the responsible mind
of the world, and the be-all and end-all of
history is the fulfilment of a world-purpose
whose objective is more than merely human
sociology. If the “nursery of the nation” has
a different interpretation, the nursery of the
nation is wrong.</p>

<p><i>The Cocoon</i> is under the impression that
there is something valuable in Youth in years;
that Youth in years is the only kind of Youth;
that Youth in years is Youth indeed. Our first
birth, however, is only a sleep and a forgetting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
and real Youth comes only after the second-birth.
The once-born are creatures of pure
circumstance, owing their youth to the accident
of time alone; but the twice-born are self-creations
defying time; they never grow old,
though they are always growing up. <i>The
Cocoon</i> fairly describes Youth as “a condition
of energy and receptiveness”; but is Youth
in years necessarily of that kind? As for
receptiveness, we have already seen that the
“historians” of the “nursery of the nation”
either hark back or hark forward to ideas long
since dead. And as for “energy,” barring
its animal manifestation in sport, the highest
culture demands the highest concentration of
energy, and where shall we find it but in the
twice-born? Whoever can make a turn upon
himself and his habits of thought is young,
whatever his years. On the other hand, whoever
cannot be “bothered” to think afresh,
but contents himself with what he used to
think is old and lacking in energy, whatever his
years or his blues.</p>

<p>It is the fate of the once-born to become
pessimistic as they grow old, as it is privilege
of the twice-born to increase in hope as they
wax in youth. One of our Cocoonists, therefore,
must be prematurely old in the former
sense, since he lifts up his lamentation that
“the beauty of English prose is already mainly
a thing of the past.” It is not a sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
for “the nursery of the nation,” and it is
altogether untrue. Beautiful English prose has
certainly been written, but the best is yet to
be. Beautiful qualities of English prose we
have certainly had revealed to us in abundance,
and some of our greatest writers have succeeded
in making an anthology in their style of two
or three or even four of them; but an English
prose with all its known qualities harmonised
and synthesised in a single style is a thing of
the future and not of the past. There are
qualities in English still unrevealed. A great
deal of “energy,” however, will be necessary
to such a synthesis. Its creator must be not
only twice-born, but, as the <i>Mahabharata</i> says
of Indian sages, “blazing with spiritual
energy,” for the fire of imagination to fuse
all the qualities of English prose into a style
is too intense for ordinary mortals.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch73"><span class="smcap">An Oxford Miscellany.</span>—<i>A Queen’s College
Miscellany</i> is filially dedicated to Walter
Pater and Ernest Dowson, both of whom, it
seems, were Queen’s men in their day. Still
another association with these writers is sought
in the comparison of the college coterie from
which each arose with the group responsible
for the present miscellany. Something of the
nature of a cult is indicated; and I take it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
that the various items of the miscellany are
“corporate” as well as individual. The foreword
says as much. In a vocabulary that
seems most ominous for literature, we are referred
to a “literary team” whose “output”
is here presented, and to an attempt to “prove
that team-work is possible in prose and
poetry.” And the miscellany is the first “harvest”
of “the refined product.” My opinion
of “team-work” is certainly that it is possible
both in prose and poetry. No individual has
ever by himself written either great prose or
great poetry, and the greatest literary works
of the world, not excepting Shakespeare, are
of anonymous—that is to say, of collective—authorship.
The elevation of the group-consciousness,
however, is everything, and I need
not remark that a group whose highest aim is
to emulate Pater and Dowson, and whose considered
“foreword” contains such terminological
ineptitudes as “team-work,” “output,”
and the “harvest” of a “refined product,”
is not yet upon a very high plane of discourse.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch74"><span class="smcap">The Impotence of Satire.</span>—A correspondent
has made the admirable suggestion
that a new <i>Don Quixote</i> be written to slay the
dragon of Capitalism with the pen of satire.
The suggestion is unconditionally free; no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
acknowledgment of its source need be made;
but anybody is at liberty to begin on the work
at once. Some excellent arguments are adduced
why the work should be undertaken.
Capitalism has long troubled the land, and its
evils are generally admitted. Reason has failed
to make any impression on the beast, and sentiment
appears almost to be its favourite food.
Satire, therefore, is plainly indicated as the
appropriate weapon, and at its crack, my correspondent
suggests, the beast would dissolve into
nothing amidst universal laughter. What more
need be said but “Cervantes, forward!”?</p>

<p>Unfortunately my correspondent proceeds to
weaken his appeal by affirming that Cervantes
himself had Capitalism in his mind when writing
certain chapters of the First Book of <i>Don
Quixote</i>. In Chaps. 44 and 45 it appears to
me, he says, that Don Quixote’s identity as a
capitalist is undoubted. Sancho Panza’s identity
with the mass of labour is equally undoubted;
and the middle classes are represented by a
number of ladies and gentlemen, a canon, a
judge, and a doctor. These chapters standing
by themselves would be a good allegorical explanation
of the present financial position. But
why of the “present” position, if satire is
capable of dissolving Capitalism in laughter?
Without questioning the allegorical character of
the chapters referred to, which may, for all I
dare say, be a perfect anticipation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
economics of Douglas—it is not encouraging to
our present-day Cervantes to be told that their
proposed method has already been tried by a
master only to leave the dragon of Capitalism
still to be tickled to death. Now one comes to
think of it, not even Chivalry, an even more
undoubted object than Capitalism of Cervantes’s
satire, really died of the shock, for the very
good reason that it was dead before Cervantes
rained his laughter upon it. Even Cervantes’s
satire killed nothing, and the task to be undertaken
for my correspondent is therefore greater
than Cervantes’. In the spirit of Squeers, I
can only suggest that he who spells window,
w-i-n-d-e-r, should clean it. My correspondent,
forward!</p>

<p>The power of satire is usually much exaggerated;
as a matter of fact, it is one of the
least effective of psychological weapons. Almost
anything can turn its edge. Juvenal is
not reported to have done much more than incur
the dislike of his contemporaries; and Swift,
the most serious satirist since Juvenal, never
effected anything by satire alone. His two
most immediately effective pamphlets, the
<i>Drapier’s Letters</i>, and the <i>Conduct of the
Allies</i>, contained passages of satire, irony, and
every other sort of appeal, but neither of them
can be called satirical as a whole. Satire,
like wit, is effective in small doses given at
opportune moments; but, as in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
wit, sustained satire defeats its own object. It
owes what power it wields to the contrast in
which it stands to the prevailing mood of the
work in which it appears: its unexpected appearance
therein. Surprise is the condition of
its doing any work at all. Surely if this were
not the case the satirical journals of, let us say,
Germany or France, would have dissolved in
laughter the vices aimed at long before now.
But satire is expected of them, is discounted
in advance, and positively adds to the attractiveness
of the objects satirised. I will not
go so far as to say that Cervantes recalled dead
Chivalry to life by satirising it, though the
crop of romances that followed <i>Don Quixote</i>
in England may almost be said to justify the
charge; but it can safely be said that a satire
directed against Capitalism would lengthen
rather than contract the life of the dragon, by
adding amusement to its claims to exist.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch75"><span class="smcap">The “Dial” of America.</span>—The American
<i>Dial</i> is perhaps the most fully realised of all
the promising literary magazines now current
in the world. It is in all probability considerably
in advance of the American reading
public for whom it is intended, but it is all the
better on that account. Culture is always called
upon to sacrifice popularity, and, usually, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
its existence, in the interests of civilisation;
for civilisation is the child of culture, and has
in general as little consideration for culture as
a human child for its own education. The
custodians of culture (or the disinterested pursuit
of human perfection) are the adults of
the race of which civilisation is the children’s
school: and, fortunately or unfortunately, in
these democratic days, their function is largely
under the control of their pupils. Gone are the
times when a Brahmanic caste can lay down
and enforce a curriculum of education for its
civilisation. Modern civilisations believe themselves
to be, and possibly are, “old enough”
to exercise their right of selecting their
teachers. It cannot be said, as yet, that they
exercise their choice with remarkable discretion,
but the process of popular self-education, if
slow, may at any rate be expected to be sure.
In any event there is no use in kicking against
the stars. If the forces of culture are to rule
modern civilisations, they must do so constitutionally.
The days of the dictatorship of
the intelligentzia are past.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of judgment which it
is essential for civilisation to acquire: judgment
of men and judgment of things. Things
are of primary importance, but so also are
persons. One is not before or after the other.
For instance, culture itself is a “thing” in
the philosophic sense; it is a reality in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the world of ideas; but of quite equal importance
in our mixed world of ideas and individuals,
are the actual persons and personalities
claiming to embody and direct culture.
Hence the transcendent importance of criticism
next to creation in both spheres: criticism of
personalities and criticism of “works.” The
mistaking of a little man for a great man,
or the reverse, may easily mean the delay of
the work of culture for whole generations.
And, equally, the confusion of the objects of
culture with the objects of civilisation may spell
the ruin of a nation. Few critics realise the
magnitude and responsibility of their function,
or the degree to which personal disinterestedness
is indispensable to its fulfilment. Holding
the office of inspectors of the munitions
of culture, they are often guilty of “passing”
contraband upon the public, and, still more
often, of failing to ensure delivery of Culture’s
most effective weapons. More seriousness is
needed, very much more, in matters of
criticism. We must be capable of killing if
we are to be capable of giving life.</p>

<p>The <i>Dial</i> is particularly to be praised for
its courageous criticism of great dead
Americans. America, like Europe, suffers from
necrophily, a kind of worship of the dead.
Indeed, as a good Injun was synonymous with
a dead Injun, a great American writer is
usually a dead American writer. All his faults<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
die with him, and only his myth remains, with
the result that people who would not have
acknowledged the existence of, let us say,
Whitman living, will not acknowledge a fault
in Whitman dead. For a nation thus under a
critical statute of Mortmain, the utterance of
what seems like blasphemy is a necessary part
of their education. They must know that the
dead great, by very virtue of their greatness
and the survival of their works, are still alive
and active, and that the same kind of criticism
must be kept playing on them as upon the
living forces. The <i>Dial</i> reviewers show no
disposition to shirk this unpleasing duty. One
by one, as the occasion suggests, the dead
great are given the honour of living criticism,
and treated as the immortal present which they
are. Since their spirits go marching on,
criticism must go marching along with them.</p>

<p>One of the recently so honoured dead in the
pages of the <i>Dial</i> has been Whitman; and
in an essay on <i>Whitman’s Love Affairs</i> Mr.
Emery Holloway throws a fresh light on an
old but still obscure subject. His “love
affairs” were obviously more matter for
criticism in Whitman than in some other
writers, since Whitman was pre-eminently an
autobiographical writer who sang himself.
What, then, does Mr. Holloway find? A little
surprisingly—at least to readers who have not
already divined Whitman’s secret—that Whitman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
“suffered” from love, and struggled
against it rather as a raw tyro than as the
“master of himself” of his poetic fiction. In
some private diaries of Whitman, quoted by
Mr. Holloway, we are presented with the
spectacle of Whitman grappling with his own
soul after the manner of saints mortifying the
flesh, or, as I would suggest, after the distinctively
modern fashion. Instinct was at war
with reason, even in Whitman, and, in the
end, as usually occurs with modern men, it
was reason that won. Mr. Holloway divides
Whitman’s works between two periods: the
first, in which he sang “untrammelled natural
impulses”; and a second, in which he was
concerned about democracy and the immortality
of the soul; in short, with reason. And between
these two periods, or worlds of discourse,
Mr. Holloway tells us, was a purgatory, in
which Whitman’s soul was tried as by fire.
The diaries already mentioned contain some
of the records of Whitman’s conflict with himself.
Here, for example, is an entry bearing
all the marks of a painful resolution. “I must,”
he says, “pursue her no more” ... and resolve
“to give up absolutely and for good,
from this present hour, the feverish, fluctuating,
useless, undignified pursuit of 164 ... avoid
seeing her or any meeting whatever from this
hour forth, for life.” The reader is to be
pitied who does not understand, however dimly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
what Whitman must have gone through in
imagination and reality to confide to the author
of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> such a shocking confession.
He emerged from the experience with that past
behind him, but still, I think, unresolved. For
it was not his to reconcile instinct with reason
in an epigenesis; he passed from one phase
to the next without carrying his sheaves with
him. From being within sight of real greatness,
he declined to the stature of a great
American.</p>

<p>Following its faithful treatment of the Whitman
myth, the <i>Dial</i> examines the case of Mark
Twain. It is undoubtedly a pathological case,
and not only Mark Twain but America was
the victim in it. A nation suffers the fate of
its great men; as is their odyssey so is the
odyssey of the nation to which they belong.
Does a great man in any nation become corrupt;
does he succumb to falsehood and to
the morality of the herd? Even so his nation
is on the downward path. On the other hand,
does he maintain his integrity, even though
his life should pay for it? There is a sign that
his nation also will battle through. From this
point of view, Mark Twain presents the
spectacle both of a tragedy and a portent.
Nobody can read his works without realising
the essential truthfulness of the man, his marvellous
capacity for intellectual honesty, his unerring
perception of the norm of things. Mark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Twain, permitted and encouraged to pass free
judgment upon American and human life,
might have been one of the cultural forces
of the new world; he was one of God’s best
gifts to America. We know, however, what
America did for Mark Twain; it slowly but
surely emasculated him in the supposed interests
of the female (not the feminine) in the
American soul. Under the influence of his
wife who, as he said, not only “edited everything
I wrote, but edited me,” under the similar
influence of all that was bourgeois in America—Mark
Twain consented to “make fun” of
everything he held dear. Talents and powers
which it is spiritual death to trade, Mark Twain
prostituted for the amusement of a people
whose deepest need was high seriousness. As
Mr. Lovett says, Mark Twain “flattered a
country without art, letters, beauty or standards
to laugh at these things.” The judgment is
severe, but it is just; and Mark Twain, I
believe, would be the first to acquiesce in it.</p>

<p>That he preserved, in the back of his mind,
his spiritual vision and knowledge, there can
be no doubt. He sinned not only against
the light, but in the light. One or two revealing
phrases in his works have escaped the
censorship of the female American he married.
“In our country,” he said, “we have three
unspeakably precious things: freedom of
thought, freedom of speech, and the prudence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
never to practise either.” It must be admitted
that this is a “snag” in the smooth current
of a work of amusement; it betokened the
existence of depths and danger. But it is
nothing to the remarks let off in conversation
on the rare occasions when the censor was
absent. “I’ve a good mind,” he once said
to a friend, “to blow the gaff on the whole
damned human race.” It is tragedy, indeed,
that he never did. We have the gaff blown
on us all too seldom, and usually by men whose
idiosyncrasies and abnormalities allow us to
ignore them. Mark Twain was such a normal
man that his blowing of the gaff could not
possibly have been attributed to a neurotic
complex derived from infantile suppression: it
would have been the judgment of man upon
Man. His failure to bestow this inestimable
gift upon America and the world we owe to
America, and if, as I have said, a nation
suffers the fate of its great men, we may be
sure that America will pay for it.</p>

<p class="section" id="ch76"><span class="smcap">America Regressing.</span>—Just when we in
Europe were beginning to envy America her
promise, contrasting it with the winter of our
own discontent, “the authorities” (as one
might say the furies, the parcæ or the weird<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
sisters) have descended upon our unfortunate
but deserving friend, the <i>Little Review</i>, and
suspended its mail service on account of its
publication of a chapter of Mr. James Joyce’s
new novel, <i>Ulysses</i>. That such an absurd act
of puritanic spleen should be possible after and
before years of world-war is evidence that
spiritual meanness is hard to transcend; and
it confirms the justice or, at least, the apprehension
expressed in Mr. Ezra Pound’s <i>bon mot</i>
that the U.S.A. should be renamed the
Y.M.C.A. Not only is the <i>Little Review</i>
perfectly harmless; would to heaven, indeed,
that it were, or could be otherwise, for never
can any good be done by something incapable
of doing harm; but the <i>Ulysses</i> of Mr. James
Joyce is one of the most interesting symptoms
in the present literary world, and its publication
is very nearly a public obligation. Such sincerity,
such energy, such fearlessness as Mr.
Joyce’s are rare in any epoch, and most of all
in our own, and on that very account they
demand to be given at least the freedom of
the Press. What the giant America can fear
from Mr. Joyce or from his publication in the
<i>Little Review</i> passes understanding. Abounding
in every variety of crime and stupidity
as America is, even if <i>Ulysses</i> were a literary
crime committed in a journal of the largest
circulation, one more or less could not make
much difference to America. But <i>Ulysses</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
no crime; but a noble experiment; and its
suppression will sadden the virtuous at the same
time that it gratifies the base. America, we
my be sure, is not going to “get culture”
by stamping upon every germ of new life.
America’s present degree of cultural toleration
may ensure a herb-garden, but not a flower
will grow upon the soil of Comstock.</p>

<p>Among the scores of interesting experiments
in composition and style exhibited in <i>Ulysses</i>,
not the least novel is Mr. Joyce’s attempt to
develop a theory of harmonics in language.
By compounding nouns with adjectives and
adjectives with adverbs, Mr. Joyce tries to
convey to the reader a complex of qualities
or ideas simultaneously instead of successively.
“Eglintoneyes looked up skybrightly.” In
such a sentence agglutination has been carried
beyond the ordinary level of particles into the
plane of words, and the effect is to present a
multitude of images as if they were one. Thus
“a new and complex knowledge of self” finds
its “appropriate medium of expression in terms
of art.” I am not so sure that Mr. Joyce has
not carried the experiment too far, but this,
again, is a virtue rather than a defect in a
pioneer. Moreover, the world needs a few
studio-magazines like the <i>Little Review</i>, and
a few studio writers like Mr. James Joyce.
What does it matter if, in his enthusiasm, Mr.
Joyce travels beyond the limits of good taste,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
beyond, that is, the already cultivated, if only
a single new literary convention is thereby
brought into common use?</p>

<p class="section" id="ch77"><span class="smcap">The Best is Yet to Be.</span>—“One dreams
of a prose,” says <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>,
“that has never yet been written in
English, though the language is made for it
and there are minds not incapable of it, a prose
dealing with the greatest things quietly and
justly as men deal with them in their secret
meditations ... the English Plato is still to
be.” Alas, however, that <i>The Times</i> should be
just a little misled, for the “quiet” of meditation
is not the real genius of the English
language, and the emphasis in the phrase,
“English Plato,” should be on the word
English. Greek Plato translated into English
would not give us what we are seeking. What
we need is Plato’s mind. It is characteristic,
however, this demand for quiet, or, rather,
quietism, in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>,
since, on the whole, the <i>Supplement</i> is about
the deadest mouse in the world of journalism.
Above all, it is suggested, writers must keep
their voices low, speak in whispers, even,
perhaps, a little under their breath as if in
meditation, in case—well, in case of what?
Is there not a <i>hush</i> in the <i>Literary Supplement</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
which is not the hush of reverence for literature,
but of fear and prudence?</p>

<p>Our writer observes very acutely that prose
is usually thought greatest when it is nearest
poetry, and he properly dissents from this
common opinion. Prose, we should say, can
only be great as it differs from poetry, and
the greatest prose is furthest away from poetry.
And the difference, we are told, is the difference
between love and justice. The cardinal virtue
of poetry, he says, is love, while the cardinal
virtue of prose is justice. May we not rather
say that the difference is one of plane of consciousness,
prose being at the highest level of
the rational mind, and poetry at the highest
level of the spiritual mind? Yes, but then,
in all probability, <i>The Times</i> would regard
us as fanciful, for note, anything <i>exact</i> about
spiritual things is likely to be dismissed by
the <i>Literary Supplement</i> as fanciful and
dangerous. Again, “prose is the achievement
of civilisation”; in other words, it is
the norm of social life. True, but let me add
that it is the register of Culture, marking the
degree to which Culture has affected its surrounding
civilisation. Prose without poetry is
impossible, and the greatest prose presupposes
the culture of the greatest poetry, for the
“justice” of prose is only the “love” of
poetry <i>with seeing eyes</i>. Finally, we must
agree with our essayist when he quotes with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
approval the excellent observation of Mr. Sturge
Moore that “simplicity <i>may</i> be a form of
decadence.” Simplicity is a sign of decadence
when it sacrifices profundity of thought to simplicity
of expression—as in the classical case
of Voltaire, who positively dared not think
deeply lest he should be unable to write clearly,
clarity of expression being more to him (and
often to the French genius generally) than
depth of thought. And writers like Mr. Clutton
Brock are just as certainly symptoms of the
decadence of simplicity in our own time and
place. On the other hand, I still dream of
a profound simplicity, the style of which is
transparent over depths; and in this, if no
English writer has ever been a master, Lao
Tse is the world’s model, at least in fragments.
We must learn to distinguish between a puerile
and a virile simplicity, between innocence and
virtue; and perhaps the first exercise in such
judgment should be to put the <i>Literary
Supplement</i> in its proper place.</p>

<p>This brings us back to quietism and the
question whether the perfect English prose
would deal with the highest things in the spirit
of man’s secret meditations. I do more than
doubt it. Secret meditation is incommunicably
secret; it is thought without words, and disposed
to poetry rather than prose. I suspect
our writer really means rumination, in which
case, however, he is no better off. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
genius of the language does not run easily
in reverie, it is a language that loves action
and life. It has few cloistered virtues, and
to employ it for cloistered thought would be
to use only one or two of its many stops, and
those not the most characteristic. Lastly, I
cannot but think that the choice of “quietism”
as the aim of perfect English prose is a sign
of decadence, for it indicates the will to retire
into oneself, and to cease to “act” by means
of words. The scene it calls up is familiar
and bourgeois: a small circle of “cultured”
men week-ending in a luxurious country
house and confessing “intimately” their
literary weaknesses. It is the prevalent atmosphere
of the <i>Literary Supplement</i> and the
<i>Spectator</i>. It is essential that there be
“equality” between them, that none should
presume to wish to inspire another to any
“new way of life,” that action, in short, should
be excluded. Once granted these conditions
of sterility, and the perfect prose, we are told,
would emerge.</p>

<p>The rest of us, however, have a very different
conception of the perfect English prose. The
perfect English prose will be anything but a
sedative after a full meal of action. It will
be not only action itself, but the cause of
action, and its deliberate aim will be to intensify
and refine action and to raise action to the
level of a fine art. Anything less than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
real effect upon real people in a real world is
beneath the dignity even of common prose.
The very “leaders” in the penny journals aim
at leaving a mark upon events. Is the perfect
prose to be without hope of posterity? On
second thoughts, I shall withdraw Plato from
the position of model in which I put him.
Plato, it is evident, is likely to be abused;
without intending it, his mood, translated into
English, appears to be compatible only with
luxurious ease; he is read by modern Epicureans.
And I shall put in Plato’s place
Demosthenes, the model of Swift, the greatest
English writer the world has yet seen. Yes,
Demosthenes let it be, since Plato is being used
for balsam. We seek an English Demosthenes.</p>

<p>The first of these papers is Religio Grammatici (the Religion of a Man
of Letters), and the phrase might almost serve as a title for the whole
book. It deals with many current questions of philosophy and literature,
such as Stoicism, Inspiration, the Soul, the Theory of Poetry, Empire
and Rebellion, from the point of view of one whose chief teachers on
these subjects have been the ancient Greeks with whom such studies
began.</p>

<p>This is a book that will be talked about. Mr. Pearson has the knack of
revealing the essential characteristics of the famous men he has known.
The book contains studies of, among others, Bernard Shaw, Frank
Harris, Sir Francis Galton, Sir Herbert Tree, Sir George Alexander,
Robert Ross, and Lytton Strachey. Besides these, the author has
rubbed shoulders with many popular idols, whom he has managed to
catch off their pedestals, including: Lloyd George, Dean Inge, G. K.
Chesterton, Horatio Bottomley, Hall Caine, H. G. Wells, Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, Arthur Bourchier, Edmund Gosse, Joseph Conrad, Mrs.
Asquith, Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>“What Mr. Sedlák is aiming at in this large and ably reasoned treatise
is an original elaboration of the whole subject matter of Hegel’s Science
of Logic.... Its remarkably well sustained continuity of abstract reflection
offers a salutary and encouraging discipline to students who will
consider its problem from its severely detached point of view.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>The object of this book is to show that social and political institutions
are not ends in themselves. The social ideal is to be sought not in the
faultless unchanging system of an institutional Utopia, but in the love of
a spiritual life with its unfailing spring of harmonious growth unconfined.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
